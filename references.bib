  abstract={Nucleosome is the elementary structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin. Instability of nucleosome positioning plays critical roles in chromatin remodeling in differentiation and disease. In this study, we investigated nucleosome dynamics in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome using a geometric model based on Z curve theory. We identified 52,941 stable nucleosomes and 7607 dynamic nucleosomes, compiling them into a genome-wide nucleosome dynamic positioning map and constructing a user-friendly visualization platform (http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/nucleosome). Our approach achieved a sensitivity of 90.31\% and a specificity of 87.76\% for S. cerevisiae. Analysis revealed transcription factor binding sites {(TFBSs)} were enriched in linkers. And among the sparse nucleosomes around {TFBSs,} dynamic nucleosomes were slightly preferred. Gene Ontology {(GO)} enrichment analysis indicated that stable and dynamic nucleosomes were enriched on genes involved in different biological processes and functions. This study provides an approach for comprehending chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation of genes.},

  abstract={Long non-coding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} are a group of molecules that function in gene regulation in yeast, plants and mammals. The precise mechanisms of action for {lncRNAs,} however, remain largely unclear. The {GAL} gene cluster has been used as a model system to study the function of these molecules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a historical focus on {lncRNA-dependent} repression. Strikingly, in characterizing the role of the {RNA} helicase Dbp2, we discovered that the {GAL} {lncRNAs} could also promote transcriptional activation of the targeted {GAL} protein-coding genes. Interestingly, these {lncRNAs} help determine how quickly the {GAL} genes can be induced in response to galactose, without altering final steady-state transcript levels. This unexpected finding suggests that one role for {lncRNAs} is to promote the timing of gene expression. Herein, we discuss our discoveries in the context of current models of {lncRNA} functions in eukaryotes, with a key emphasis on future challenges for genomic research.},

This process is highly regulated, ensuring that only {RNAPII} molecules that cannot otherwise be salvaged are degraded.

  abstract={Transfer {RNAs} {(tRNAs)} are essential for protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, {tRNA} biosynthesis employs a specialized {RNA} polymerase that generates initial transcripts that must be subsequently altered via a multitude of post-transcriptional steps before the {tRNAs} beome mature molecules that function in protein synthesis. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into {tRNA} turnover and {tRNA} subcellular dynamics. {tRNA} processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of {CCA} to the 3' mature sequence and, for {tRNA(His),} addition of a 5' G. About 20\% of yeast {tRNAs} are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to {tRNA} splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating {tRNAs} in which {\&\#x223C;15\%} of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including {tRNA} discrimination, translation fidelity, and {tRNA} quality control. Mature {tRNAs} are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded {tRNAs.} Mature {tRNAs} are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain.},

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} synthesizes a diverse set of transcripts including both protein-coding and non-coding {RNAs.} One major difference between these two classes of transcripts is the mechanism of termination. Messenger {RNA} transcripts terminate downstream of the coding region in a process that is coupled to cleavage and polyadenylation reactions. Non-coding transcripts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae {snoRNAs} terminate in a process that requires the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1. We report here the transcriptome-wide distribution of these termination factors. These data sets derived from in vivo {protein-RNA} cross-linking provide high-resolution definition of {non-poly(A)} terminators, identify novel genes regulated by attenuation of nascent transcripts close to the promoter, and demonstrate the widespread occurrence of Nrd1-bound 3' antisense transcripts on genes that are poorly expressed. In addition, we show that Sen1 does not cross-link efficiently to many expected non-coding {RNAs} but does cross-link to the 3' end of most {pre-mRNA} transcripts, suggesting an extensive role in {mRNA} 3' end formation and/or termination.},

Comparative genomics has recently been used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the yeast genome on the basis of phylogenetic conservation, but this information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional regulators occupy these binding sites. We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use of regulatory elements predicts mechanistic models for the function of a large population of yeast's transcriptional regulators.},

Here we present the results of a high-throughput synthetic lethality screen for genes that interact with {NRD1} and show roles for Nrd1 in the regulation of mitochondrial abundance and cell size. We also provide genetic evidence of interactions between the {Nrd1-Nab3} and Ras/protein kinase A {(PKA)} pathways. Whereas the Ras pathway promotes the transcription of genes involved in growth and glycolysis, the {Nrd1-Nab3} pathway appears to have a novel role in the rapid suppression of some genes when cells are shifted to poor growth conditions. We report the identification of new {mRNA} targets of the {Nrd1-Nab3} pathway that are rapidly repressed in response to glucose depletion. Glucose depletion also leads to the dephosphorylation of Nrd1 and the formation of novel nuclear speckles that contain Nrd1 and Nab3.

  abstract={Chromatin organization plays a major role in gene regulation and can affect the function and evolution of new transcriptional programs. However, it can be difficult to decipher the basis of changes in chromatin organization and their functional effect on gene expression. Here, we present a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the relationship between chromatin organization and gene expression, by measuring {mRNA} abundance and nucleosome positions genome-wide in 12 Hemiascomycota yeast species. We found substantial conservation of global and functional chromatin organization in all species, including prominent nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} at gene promoters, and distinct chromatin architecture in growth and stress genes. Chromatin organization has also substantially diverged in both global quantitative features, such as spacing between adjacent nucleosomes, and in functional groups of genes. Expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and trans-acting chromatin modifiers all play important, complementary, and evolvable roles in determining {NFRs.} We identify five mechanisms that couple chromatin organization to evolution of gene regulation and have contributed to the evolution of respiro-fermentation and other key systems, including (1) compensatory evolution of alternative modifiers associated with conserved chromatin organization, (2) a gradual transition from constitutive to trans-regulated {NFRs,} (3) a loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences accompanying changes in chromatin organization and gene expression, (4) re-positioning of motifs from {NFRs} to nucleosome-occluded regions, and (5) the expanded use of {NFRs} by paralogous activator-repressor pairs.

We inactivated spliceosomes by disrupting a metal-ligand interaction at the catalytic center and discovered that, when the {DEAH} box {ATPase} Prp16 was disabled, these spliceosomes catalyzed 5' splice site cleavage but at a reduced rate. Although Prp16 does not promote splicing of a genuine substrate until after 5' splice site cleavage, we found that Prp16 can associate with spliceosomes before 5' splice site cleavage, consistent with a role for Prp16 in proofreading 5' splice site cleavage. We established that Prp16-mediated rejection is reversible, necessitating a downstream discard pathway that we found requires the {DEAH} box {ATPase} Prp43, a spliceosome disassembly factor. These data indicate that spliceosomes distinguish slow substrates and that the mechanisms for establishing the fidelity of 5' splice site cleavage and exon ligation share a common {ATP-dependent} framework.},

  abstract={In Drosophila, mutation of the oncogene Myb reduced the expression of mitotic genes, such as polo and ial, and caused multiple mitotic defects, including disrupted chromosome condensation and abnormal spindles. We now show that binucleate cells, the hallmark phenotype of cytokinesis failure, accumulate in Myb-null ovarian follicle cell and wing disc epithelia. Myb functions as an activator in the generally repressive Drosophila {RBF,} {E2F2,} and Myb {(dREAM)/Myb-MuvB} complex. Absence of the {dREAM} subunit Mip130 or {E2F2} suppressed the Myb-null cytokinesis defect. Therefore, we used Myb-null binucleate cells as a quantitative phenotypic readout of transcriptional repression by the {dREAM} complex. In the absence of Myb, the complex was sensitive to the dose of the subunits {E2F2,} Mip120, Caf1, and Lin-52 but not Mip130 or Mip40. Surprisingly, reduction of the dose of {His2Av/H2A.z} also suppressed the Myb-null binucleate cell phenotype, suggesting a novel role for this variant histone in transcriptional repression by the {dREAM} complex.},

  abstract={In eukaryotic cells, there is evidence for functional coupling between transcription and processing of {pre-mRNAs.} To better understand this coupling, we performed a high-resolution kinetic analysis of transcription and splicing in budding yeast. This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, {RNA} polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced {mRNA} and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.},

Here we investigate this process genome-wide and measure the whole transcriptome of various histone modification mutants in a \&\#x394;rrp6 strain using tiling arrays. We confirm widespread occurrence of potentially antisense-dependent gene regulation and identify three functionally distinct classes of genes that accumulate {asRNAs} in the absence of Rrp6. These classes differ in whether the genes are silenced by the {asRNA} and whether the silencing is {HDACs} and histone methyl transferase-dependent. Among the distinguishing features of {asRNAs} with regulatory potential, we identify weak early termination by {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1,} extension of the {asRNA} into the open reading frame promoter and dependence of the silencing capacity on Set1 and the {HDACs} Hda1 and Rpd3 particularly at promoters undergoing extensive chromatin remodelling. Finally, depending on the efficiency of {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1} early termination, {asRNA} levels are modulated and their capability of silencing is changed.},

  abstract={Intron lariat {RNAs,} created by {pre-mRNA} splicing, are sources of information on gene expression and structure. Although produced equivalently to their corresponding {mRNAs,} the vast majority of intron lariat {RNAs} are rapidly degraded. However, their levels are enhanced in cells deficient for {RNA} debranching enzyme, which catalyzes linearization of these {RNAs,} the rate-limiting step in their degradation. Furthermore, {RNA} lariats are resistant to degradation by the 3' exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase {(PNPase),} providing a means to enrich for lariat {RNAs.} Working with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, our goal was to develop novel combinations of methods to enhance the use of intron lariat {RNAs} as objects of study. Using {RT-PCR} assays developed for detecting and quantifying specific lariat {RNAs,} we demonstrate the resistance of {RNA} lariats to degradation by {PNPase} and their sensitivity to cleavage by {RNA} debranching enzyme. We also employ sequential treatments with these two enzymes to produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs.} We establish the utility of the methods for analyzing {RNA} debranching enzyme variants and in vitro debranching reactions and discuss several possible applications, including measuring relative rates of transcription and combining these methods with non-gene-specific {RNA} sequencing as a novel approach for genome annotation. In summary, enzymatic treatments that produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs,} combined with {RT-PCR} or {RNA} sequencing, can be powerful tools to advance studies on gene expression, alternative splicing, and any process that depends on the {RNA} debranching enzyme.},

Furthermore, high elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity {DNA} sequence and distance from nearest active transcription unit.

  abstract={Because {DNA} packaging in nucleosomes modulates its accessibility to transcription factors {(TFs),} unraveling the causal determinants of nucleosome positioning is of great importance to understanding gene regulation. Although there is evidence that intrinsic sequence specificity contributes to nucleosome positioning, the extent to which other factors contribute to nucleosome positioning is currently highly debated. Here we obtained both in vivo and in vitro reference maps of positions that are either consistently covered or free of nucleosomes across multiple experimental data-sets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then systematically quantified the contribution of {TF} binding to nucleosome positioning using a rigorous statistical mechanics model in which {TFs} compete with nucleosomes for binding {DNA.} Our results reconcile previous seemingly conflicting results on the determinants of nucleosome positioning and provide a quantitative explanation for the difference between in vivo and in vitro positioning. On a genome-wide scale, nucleosome positioning is dominated by the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies, and their positioning is mainly determined by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which likely have a much more significant impact on gene expression, are determined mainly by {TF} binding. Interestingly, of the 158 yeast {TFs} included in our modeling, we find that only 10-20 significantly contribute to inducing nucleosome-free regions, and these {TFs} are highly enriched for having direct interactions with chromatin remodelers. Together our results imply that nucleosome free regions in yeast promoters results from the binding of a specific class of {TFs} that recruit chromatin remodelers.},

  abstract={High-throughput omics data often contain systematic biases introduced during various steps of sample processing and data generation. As the source of these biases is usually unknown, it is difficult to select an optimal normalization method for a given data set. To facilitate this process, we introduce the open-source tool {{"}Normalyzer{"}.} It normalizes the data with 12 different normalization methods and generates a report with several quantitative and qualitative plots for comparative evaluation of different methods. The usefulness of Normalyzer is demonstrated with three different case studies from quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics. The results from these case studies show that the choice of normalization method strongly influences the outcome of downstream quantitative comparisons. Normalyzer is an R package and can be used locally or through the online implementation at http://quantitativeproteomics.org/normalyzer .},

  abstract={Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, {NET-seq),} based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with {RNA} polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of {NET-seq} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the {Rpd3S} deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

In this method, nuclear run-on {RNA} molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger {RNA} 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter.

  abstract={Messenger {RNA} splicing is an essential and complex process for the removal of intron sequences. Whereas the composition of the splicing machinery is mostly known, the kinetics of splicing, the catalytic activity of splicing factors and the interdependency of transcription, splicing and {mRNA} 3' end formation are less well understood. We propose a stochastic model of splicing kinetics that explains data obtained from high-resolution kinetic analyses of transcription, splicing and 3' end formation during induction of an intron-containing reporter gene in budding yeast. Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing. Model comparison is used to assess the alternative representations of reactions. Modelling also indicates the functional coupling of transcription and splicing, because both the rate of initiation of transcription and the probability that step one of splicing occurs co-transcriptionally are reduced, when the second step of splicing is abolished in a mutant reporter.},

Here we show that the action of the essential {RSC} remodeling complex in S. cerevisiae helps explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment. In {RSC-depleted} cells, {NFRs} shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. Nucleosome positioning at distinct subsets of promoters additionally requires the essential Myb family proteins Abf1 and Reb1, whose binding sites are enriched in {NFRs.} In contrast, {H2A.Z} deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning. By regulating {H2A.Z} deposition using a steroid-inducible protein splicing strategy, we show that {NFR} establishment is necessary for {H2A.Z} deposition.

  abstract={Sequence-specific pausing of multisubunit {RNA} polymerases {(RNAPs)} represents a rate-limiting step during transcription elongation. Pausing occurs on average every 100 bases of {DNA.} Several models have been proposed to explain pausing, including backtracking of the ternary elongation complex, delay of translocation of the enzyme along {DNA,} or a conformational change in the active site preventing formation of the phosphodiester bond. Here, we performed biochemical characterization of previously-reported pauses of Escherichia coli {RNAP} and found that they are not associated with backtracking or a translocation delay. Instead, the paused complex contains the 3' end of the transcript in the active center and is capable of binding the next cognate {NTP.} However, bond formation occurs much slower in the paused complex compared with its fully-active counterpart. The pausing is dramatically decreased by a substitution of the base encoding the next incoming {NTP} and the base encoding the 3' end of the nascent {RNA,} suggesting that (mis)-alignment of the 3' end of the {RNA} and the incoming {NTP} in the active site is crucial for pausing. These pause sites are conserved between E. coli and Thermus thermophilus {RNAPs,} but are not recognized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNAP} {II,} indicating that prokaryotic {RNAPs} might be more sensitive to the changes in the alignment of the nascent transcript and the substrate {NTP} in the active site.},

  abstract={Pausing of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP} {II)} by backtracking on {DNA} is a major regulatory mechanism in control of eukaryotic transcription. Backtracking occurs by extrusion of the 3' end of the {RNA} from the active center after bond formation and before translocation of {RNAP} {II} on {DNA.} In several documented cases, backtracking requires a special signal such as {A/T-rich} sequences forming an unstable {RNA-DNA} hybrid in the elongation complex. However, other sequence-dependent backtracking signals and conformations of {RNAP} {II} leading to backtracking remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate with S. cerevisiae {RNAP} {II} that a cleavage-deficient elongation factor {TFIIS} {(TFIIS(AA))} enhances backtracked pauses during regular transcription. This is due to increased efficiency of formation of an intermediate that leads to backtracking. This intermediate may involve misalignment at the 3' end of the nascent {RNA} in the active center of the yeast {RNAP} {II,} and {TFIIS(AA)} promotes formation of this intermediate at the {DNA} sequences, presenting a high-energy barrier to translocation. We proposed a three-step mechanism for {RNAP} {II} pausing in which a prolonged dwell time in the pre-translocated state increases the likelihood of the 3' {RNA} end misalignment facilitating a backtrack pausing. These results demonstrate an important role of the intrinsic blocks to forward translocation in pausing by {RNAP} {II.}},

We generated a homogeneous set of several hundreds of artificial, {NNS-dependent} terminators with an in vivo selection approach. Analysis of these terminators revealed novel and extended sequence determinants for transcription termination and {NNS} complex binding as well as supermotifs that are critical for termination. Biochemical and structural data revealed that affinity and specificity of {RNA} recognition by Nab3p relies on induced fit recognition implicating an {\&\#x3B1;-helical} extension of the {RNA} recognition motif. Interestingly, the same motifs can be recognized by the {NNS} or the {mRNA} termination complex depending on their position relative to the start of transcription, suggesting that they function as general transcriptional insulators to prevent interference between the non-coding and the coding yeast transcriptomes.},

  abstract={Spliceosome assembly in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recently shown to occur at the site of transcription. However, evidence for cotranscriptional splicing as well as for coupling between transcription and splicing is still lacking. Using modifications of a previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation {(ChIP)} assay, we show that cotranscriptional splicing occurs approximately 1 kb after transcription of the 3' splice site {(3'SS).} This pathway furthermore protects most intron-containing nascent transcripts from the effects of cleavage by an intronic hammerhead ribozyme. This suggests that a high percentage of introns are recognized cotranscriptionally. This observation led us to screen a small deletion library for strains that sensitize a splicing reporter to ribozyme cleavage. Characterization of the Deltamud2 strain indicates that the early splicing factor Mud2p functions with U1 {snRNP} to form a cross-intron bridging complex on nascent {pre-mRNA.} The complex helps protect the transcript from ribozyme-mediated destruction and suggests an intron-definition event early in the spliceosome assembly process. The transcription elongation mutant strains Deltadst1 and Deltapaf1 show different cotranscriptional splicing phenotypes, suggesting that different transcription pathways differentially impact the efficiency of nascent intron definition.},

  abstract={The assessment of transcriptional regulation requires a genome-wide survey of active {RNA} polymerases. Thus, we combined the nuclear run-on assay, which labels and captures nascent transcripts, with high-throughput {DNA} sequencing to examine transcriptional activity in exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence read data from these nuclear run-on libraries revealed that transcriptional regulation in yeast occurs not only at the level of {RNA} polymerase recruitment to promoters but also at postrecruitment steps. Nascent synthesis signals are strongly enriched at {TSS} throughout the yeast genome, particularly at histone loci. Nascent transcripts reveal antisense transcription for more than 300 genes, with the read data providing support for the activity of distinct promoters driving transcription in opposite directions rather than bidirectional transcription from single promoters. By monitoring total {RNA} in parallel, we found that transcriptional activity accounts for 80\% of the variance in transcript abundance. We computed {RNA} stabilities from nascent and steady-state transcripts for each gene and found that the most stable and unstable transcripts encode proteins whose functional roles are consistent with these stabilities. We also surveyed transcriptional activity after heat shock and found that most, but not all, heat shock-inducible genes increase their abundance by increasing their {RNA} synthesis. In summary, this study provides a genome-wide view of {RNA} polymerase activity in yeast, identifies regulatory steps in the synthesis of transcripts, and analyzes transcript stabilities.},

Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites having a wide range of affinities. These results indicate that {DNA-binding} transcription factors affect chromatin structure, and probably dynamics, throughout the genome to a much greater extent than previously appreciated.},

  abstract={The packaging of eukaryotic genomes into nuclesomes plays critical roles in chromatin organization and gene regulation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal {DNA} sequences, such as {poly(A)} sequences, as well as by binding sites for trans-acting factors that can evict nucleosomes, such as Reb1 and the Rsc3/30 complex. Here, we use genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 Ascomycota fungi to discover large-scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure. We find that {poly(G)s} act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences, comparable to the known function of {poly(A)s,} but that the abundance of {poly(G)s} has diverged greatly between species, obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in {low-poly(G)} species such as S. cerevisiae. We also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans-acting general regulatory factor {(GRF)} binding sites. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by {GRFs} have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of {GRFs.} We experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from Cbf1 as a major {GRF} in pre-whole-genome duplication {(WGD)} yeasts to Reb1 in {post-WGD} yeasts. We further show that the mating type switch-activating protein Sap1 is a {GRF} in S. pombe, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. Our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization.},

Remarkably, the absence of both Myb and Mip130, or of both Myb and {E2F2,} caused variegated expression in which high or low levels of Polo were stably inherited through successive cell divisions in imaginal wing discs. Restoration of Myb resulted in a uniformly high level of Polo expression similar to that seen in wild-type tissue, whereas restoration of Mip130 or {E2F2} extinguished Polo expression. Our results demonstrate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by Myb, {Mip130/LIN-9,} and {E2F2-RBF} in vivo, and also provide an explanation for the ability of Mip130-null mutants to rescue the lethality of Myb-null mutants in vivo.},

  abstract={A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA-Seq} gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods {(GLMs)} to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA-Seq} applications, including {ChIP-Seq} for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

  abstract={Splicing is the removal of intron sequences from {pre-mRNA} by the spliceosome. Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that {pre-mRNA} can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally). Co-transcriptional splicing does not assume that transcription and splicing machineries are mechanistically coupled, yet it raises this possibility. Early studies were based on a limited number of genes, which were often chosen because of their experimental accessibility. Since 2010, eight studies have used global datasets as counting tools, in order to quantify co-transcriptional intron removal. The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Here, we discuss the nature of the various global datasets and how bioinformatic analyses were conducted. Considering the broad differences in experimental approach and analysis, the level of agreement on the prevalence of co-transcriptional splicing is remarkable.},

There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling.

  abstract={It is now experimentally well known that variant sequences of a cis transcription factor binding site motif can contribute to differential regulation of genes. We characterize the relationship between motif variants and gene expression by analyzing expression microarray data and binding site predictions. To accomplish this, we statistically detect motif variants with effects that differ among environments. Such environmental specificity may be due to either affinity differences between variants or, more likely, differential interactions of {TFs} bound to these variants with cofactors, and with differential presence of cofactors across environments. We examine conservation of functional variants across four Saccharomyces species, and find that about a third of transcription factors have target genes that are differentially expressed in a condition-specific manner that is correlated with the nucleotide at variant motif positions. We find good correspondence between our results and some cases in the experimental literature {(Reb1,} Sum1, Mcm1, and Rap1). These results and growing consensus in the literature indicates that motif variants may often be functionally distinct, that this may be observed in genomic data, and that variants play an important role in condition-specific gene regulation.},

We identified \&gt;25,000 distinct {RNA} species in human fibroblasts that contained non-colinear exons (a {"}backsplice{"}) and were reproducibly enriched by exonuclease degradation of linear {RNA.} These {RNAs} were validated as circular {RNA} {(ecircRNA),} rather than linear {RNA,} and were more stable than associated linear {mRNAs} in vivo. In some cases, the abundance of circular molecules exceeded that of associated linear {mRNA} by \&gt;10-fold. By conservative estimate, we identified {ecircRNAs} from 14.4\% of actively transcribed genes in human fibroblasts. Application of this method to murine testis {RNA} identified 69 {ecircRNAs} in precisely orthologous locations to human circular {RNAs.} Of note, paralogous kinases {HIPK2} and {HIPK3} produce abundant {ecircRNA} from their second exon in both humans and mice. Though {HIPK3} circular {RNAs} contain an {AUG} translation start, it and other {ecircRNAs} were not bound to ribosomes. Circular {RNAs} could be degraded by {siRNAs} and, therefore, may act as competing endogenous {RNAs.} Bioinformatic analysis revealed shared features of circularized exons, including long bordering introns that contained complementary {ALU} repeats.

At {MET} genes Cbf1p appears to function in both activator recruitment and chromatin-remodeling. Cbf1p has been implicated in the regulation of other genes, and {CACRTG} motifs are common in potential gene regulatory {DNA.} A recent genome-wide location analysis showed that the majority of intergenic {CACGTG} palindromes are bound by Cbf1p. Here we tested whether all potential Cbf1p binding motifs in the yeast genome are likely to be bound by Cbf1p using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We also tested which of the motifs are actually functional by assaying for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin remodeling. We show that Cbf1p binding and activity is restricted to palindromic {CACGTG} motifs in promoter-proximal regions. Cbf1p does not function through {CACGTG} motifs that occur in promoter-distal locations within coding regions nor where {CACATG} motifs occur alone except at centromeres. Cbf1p can be made to function at promoter-distal {CACGTG} motifs by overexpression, suggesting that the concentration of Cbf1p is normally limiting for binding and is biased to gene regulatory {DNA} by interactions with other factors. We conclude that Cbf1p is required for normal nucleosome positioning wherever the {CACGTG} motif occurs in gene regulatory {DNA.} Cbf1p has been shown to interact with the chromatin-remodeling {ATPase} Isw1p. Here we show that recruitment of Isw1p by Cbf1p is likely to be general but that Isw1p is only partially required for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin structures.},

  abstract={Transcription by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II),} and all {RNA} polymerases for that matter, may be understood as comprising two cycles. The first cycle relates to the basic mechanism of the transcription process wherein Pol {II} must select the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate complementary to the {DNA} template, catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, and translocate to the next position on the {DNA} template. Performing this cycle in an iterative fashion allows the synthesis of {RNA} chains that can be over one million nucleotides in length in some larger eukaryotes. Overlaid upon this enzymatic cycle, transcription may be divided into another cycle of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Each of these phases has a large number of associated transcription factors that function to promote or regulate the gene expression process. Complicating matters, each phase of the latter transcription cycle are coincident with cotranscriptional {RNA} processing events. Additionally, transcription takes place within a highly dynamic and regulated chromatin environment. This chromatin environment is radically impacted by active transcription and associated chromatin modifications and remodeling, while also functioning as a major platform for Pol {II} regulation. This review will focus on our basic knowledge of the Pol {II} transcription mechanism, and how altered Pol {II} activity impacts gene expression in vivo in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The nucleosome-specific pausing pattern of {RNAP} is comparable with that of Pol {II.} At physiological ionic strength or lower, the nucleosome blocks {RNAP} progression along the template, but this barrier can be relieved at higher ionic strength. Transcription through the nucleosome by {RNAP} results in the loss of an {H2A/H2B} dimer, and the histones that remain in the hexasome retain their original positions on the {DNA.} The results were similar for elongation complexes that were assembled from components (oligonucleotides and {RNAP)} and elongation complexes obtained by initiation from the promoter. The data suggest that eukaryotic Pol {II} and E. coli {RNAP} utilize very similar mechanisms for transcription through the nucleosome. Thus, bacterial {RNAP} can be used as a suitable model system to study general aspects of chromatin transcription by Pol {II.} Furthermore, the data argue that the general elongation properties of polymerases may determine the mechanism used for transcription through the nucleosome.},

Together with results of in vitro assays, these data reveal a complex interplay between the modifying enzymes, and provide evidence that the {CTD} cycle is uniform across genes. We also identify Ssu72 as the Ser7 phosphatase and show that proline isomerization is a key regulator of {CTD} dephosphorylation at the end of genes.},

  abstract={Identifying genes in the genomic context is central to a cell's ability to interpret the genome. Yet, in general, the signals used to define eukaryotic genes are poorly described. Here, we derived simple classifiers that identify where transcription will initiate and terminate using nucleic acid sequence features detectable by the yeast cell, which we integrate into a Unified Model {(UM)} that models transcription as a whole. The cis-elements that denote where transcription initiates function primarily through nucleosome depletion, and, using a synthetic promoter system, we show that most of these elements are sufficient to initiate transcription in vivo. Hrp1 binding sites are the major characteristic of terminators; these binding sites are often clustered in terminator regions and can terminate transcription bidirectionally. The {UM} predicts global transcript structure by modeling transcription of the genome using a hidden Markov model whose emissions are the outputs of the initiation and termination classifiers. We validated the novel predictions of the {UM} with available {RNA-seq} data and tested it further by directly comparing the transcript structure predicted by the model to the transcription generated by the cell for synthetic {DNA} segments of random design. We show that the {UM} identifies transcription start sites more accurately than the initiation classifier alone, indicating that the relative arrangement of promoter and terminator elements influences their function. Our model presents a concrete description of how the cell defines transcript units, explains the existence of nongenic transcripts, and provides insight into genome evolution.},

The Hrp1 and Nab2 proteins act at this decision point, with dual roles in {mRNA} cleavage/polyadenylation and {lncRNA} surveillance.

By quantifying {RNA} expression on both strands of the complete genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a high-density oligonucleotide tiling array, this study identifies the boundary, structure, and level of coding and noncoding transcripts. A total of 85\% of the genome is expressed in rich media. Apart from expected transcripts, we found operon-like transcripts, transcripts from neighboring genes not separated by intergenic regions, and genes with complex transcriptional architecture where different parts of the same gene are expressed at different levels. We mapped the positions of 3' and 5' {UTRs} of coding genes and identified hundreds of {RNA} transcripts distinct from annotated genes. These nonannotated transcripts, on average, have lower sequence conservation and lower rates of deletion phenotype than protein coding genes. Many other transcripts overlap known genes in antisense orientation, and for these pairs global correlations were discovered: {UTR} lengths correlated with gene function, localization, and requirements for regulation; antisense transcripts overlapped 3' {UTRs} more than 5' {UTRs;} {UTRs} with overlapping antisense tended to be longer; and the presence of antisense associated with gene function. These findings may suggest a regulatory role of antisense transcription in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the data show that even this well studied genome has transcriptional complexity far beyond current annotation.},

  abstract={Nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin, have a critical role in the control of gene expression. Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect {DNA} from {GpC} methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible {PHO5} gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the {PHO5} promoter that introduce a {poly(dA:dT)} tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of {PHO5.} By contrast, mutations that altered {AA/TT/AT} periodicity reduced gene expression upon {PHO5} induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for {DNA} antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as {"}fuzzy{"} or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

Deletion of the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6 allows visualization of noncoding {RNA} intermediates that are terminated but not yet processed. Sen1 mutants or faster-transcribing Pol {II} increase the average lengths of preprocessed {snoRNA,} {CUT,} and {SUT} transcripts, while slowed Pol {II} transcription produces shorter transcripts.

This is the same processing pathway used by yeast {snoRNAs.} Whereas {CUTs} are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts {(SUTs)} are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that {SUTs} are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay {(NMD).} Therefore, {SUTs} may be processed similarly to {mRNAs.} Surprisingly, both {CUTs} and {SUTs} were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended {CUTs} and {SUTs} are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding {RNAs} found in higher eukaryotes.},

We describe here a nonconventional mechanism of transcriptional regulation that relies on the selection of alternative transcription start sites to generate {CUTs} or {mRNAs.} Transcription from {TATA} box proximal start sites generates unstable transcripts and downregulates expression of the {URA2} gene under repressing conditions.

  abstract={Cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} are widely distributed in the genome of S. cerevisiae. These {RNAs} generally derive from nonannotated regions of the genome and are degraded rapidly and efficiently by the nuclear exosome via a pathway that involves degradative polyadenylation by a new {poly(A)} polymerase borne by the {TRAMP} complex. What is the share of significant information that is encrypted in {CUTs} and what distinguishes a {CUT} from other Pol {II} transcripts are unclear to date. Here we report the dissection of the molecular mechanism that leads to degradation of a model {CUT,} {NEL025c.} We show that the {Nrd1p-Nab3p-dependent} pathway, involved in transcription termination of {sno/snRNAs,} is required, albeit not sufficient, for efficient degradation of {NEL025c} {RNAs} and at least a subset of other {CUTs.} Our results suggest an important role for the {Nrd1p-Nab3p} pathway in the control of gene expression throughout the genome.},

  abstract={Non-coding {(nc)RNAs} are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability. Large {ncRNAs} interact with histone modifiers and are involved in cancer development, X-chromosome inactivation and autosomal gene imprinting. However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought, only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory {ncRNAs} are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' {RNA} exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory {ncRNA} family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq),} we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts {(XUTs)} in which 66\% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)-dependent.} The majority of {XUTs} strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, {RNAPII} chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by {DNA} sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of {RNAPII} occupancy over 273 genes with antisense {XUTs.} These genes show an unusual bias for {H3K4me3} marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing {H3K4me3} triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense {XUTs,} supporting a model in which {H3K4me3} antagonizes antisense {ncRNA} repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense {ncRNA-mediated} regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.},

We analyzed the transcriptome of combinations of Rrp6p and Dis3p catalytic mutants by high-resolution tiling arrays. We show that Dis3p and Rrp6p have both overlapping and specific roles in degrading distinct classes of substrates. We found that transcripts derived from more than half of intron-containing genes are degraded before splicing. Surprisingly, we also show that the exosome degrades large amounts of {tRNA} precursors despite the absence of processing defects. These results underscore the notion that large amounts of {RNAs} produced in wild-type cells are discarded before entering functional pathways and suggest that kinetic competition with degradation proofreads the efficiency and accuracy of processing.},

Using high-resolution profiling we identified an extensive meiotic {ncRNA} expression program interlaced with the protein-coding transcriptome via sense/antisense transcript pairs, bidirectional promoters, and {ncRNAs} that overlap the regulatory regions of genes. Meiotic unannotated transcripts {(MUTs)} are mitotic targets of the conserved exosome component Rrp6, which itself is degraded after the onset of meiosis when {MUTs} and other {ncRNAs} accumulate in successive waves. Diploid cells lacking Rrp6 fail to initiate premeiotic {DNA} replication normally and cannot undergo efficient meiotic development. The present study demonstrates a unique function for budding yeast Rrp6 in degrading distinct classes of meiotically induced {ncRNAs} during vegetative growth and the onset of meiosis and thus points to a critical role of differential {ncRNA} expression in the execution of a conserved developmental program.},

Accordingly, four deviations from previously proposed rules for third position wobble pairing in yeast, three {G:U} and one {A:I} codon-anticodon pairings, were found to be required to account for the reading of 61 coding triplets. The gene copy number for individual {tRNA} species, which ranges from one to 16, correlates well with both the frequency of codon occurrence in a sample of 1756 distinct protein coding sequences (r = 0.82) and the previously measured intracellular content of 21 {tRNA} species. A close link between {tRNA} gene redundancy and the overall amino acid composition of yeast proteins was also observed. Regression analysis values for individual protein coding sequences proved to be effective descriptions of the translational selective pressure operating on a particular gene. A significantly stronger co-adaptation between codon choice and {tRNA} gene copy number was observed in highly expressed genes. These observations strongly support the notion that intracellular {tRNA} levels in normally growing yeast cells are mainly determined by gene copy number, which, along with codon choice, is the key parameter acted upon by translational selection.},

Existing evidence suggests that the genes congregate together at the nucleolus and/or centromeres. In this study, we re-examined spatial and temporal aspects of {tRNA} gene {(tDNA)} expression. We show that {tDNA} transcription fluctuates during cell cycle progression. In M phase, when {tRNA} synthesis peaks, {tDNAs} localize at nuclear pore complexes {(NPCs).} Docking of a {tDNA} requires the {DNA} sequence of the contacted gene, nucleoporins Nup60 and Nup2, and cohesin. Characterization of mutants that block {NPC} localization revealed that docking is a consequence of elevated {tDNA} transcription. {NPC-tDNA} contact falters in the absence of the principal exportin of nascent {tRNA,} Los1, and genetic assays indicate that gating of {tDNAs} at {NPCs} favors cytoplasmic accumulation of functional {tRNA.} Collectively, the data suggest that {tDNAs} associate with {NPCs} to coordinate {RNA} polymerase {III} transcription with the nuclear export of {pre-tRNA.} The M-phase specificity of {NPC} contact reflects a regulatory mechanism that may have evolved, in part, to avoid collisions between {DNA} replication forks and transcribing {RNA} polymerase {III} machinery at {NPCs.}},

  abstract={{ChIP-seq} has become a major tool for the genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding or histone modification sites. Most peak-calling algorithms require input control datasets to model the occurrence of background reads to account for local sequencing and {GC} bias. However, the {GC-content} of reads in Input-seq datasets deviates significantly from that in {ChIP-seq} datasets. Moreover, we observed that a commonly used peak calling program performed equally well when the use of a simulated uniform background set was compared to an Input-seq dataset. This contradicts the assumption that input control datasets are necessary to fatefully reflect the background read distribution. Because the {GC-content} of the abundant single reads in {ChIP-seq} datasets is similar to those of randomly sampled regions we designed a peak-calling algorithm with a background model based on overlapping single reads. The application, {OccuPeak,} uses the abundant low frequency tags present in each {ChIP-seq} dataset to model the background, thereby avoiding the need for additional datasets. Analysis of the performance of {OccuPeak} showed robust model parameters. Its measure of peak significance, the excess ratio, is only dependent on the tag density of a peak and the global noise levels. Compared to the commonly used peak-calling applications {MACS} and {CisGenome,} {OccuPeak} had the highest sensitivity in an enhancer identification benchmark test, and performed similar in an overlap tests of transcription factor occupation with {DNase} I hypersensitive sites and {H3K27ac} sites. Moreover, peaks called by {OccuPeak} were significantly enriched with cardiac disease-associated {SNPs.} {OccuPeak} runs as a standalone application and does not require extensive tweaking of parameters, making its use straightforward and user friendly.

In this work, we examine the degradation pathway of the {RNA} {SRG1,} which is produced from an intergenic region and contributes to the regulation of the {SER3} gene by promoter occlusion during {SRG1} transcription. Although there is some effect on {SRG1} transcript levels when the nuclear exosome is compromised, the bulk of the {SRG1} {RNA} is degraded in the cytoplasm by decapping and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic digestion. Examination of other {CUTs} suggests that individual {CUTs} can be degraded by a variety of different mechanisms, including nuclear decay, cytoplasmic decapping and 5'-to-3' decay, and nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, some {CUTs} appear to be associated with polyribosomes. These results indicate that some {CUTs} can be exported from the nucleus and enter translation before being degraded, identifying a potential mechanism for the evolution of new protein-encoding genes.},

  abstract={Recent experiments provide an unprecedented view of {protein-DNA} binding in yeast and human genomes at single-nucleotide resolution. These measurements, performed over large cell populations, show quite generally that sequence-specific transcription regulators with well-defined {protein-DNA} consensus motifs bind only a fraction among all consensus motifs present in the genome. Alternatively, proteins in vivo often bind {DNA} regions lacking known consensus sequences. The rules determining whether a consensus motif is functional remain incompletely understood. Here we predict that genomic background surrounding specific {protein-DNA} binding motifs statistically modulates the binding of sequence-specific transcription regulators to these motifs. In particular, we show that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding in yeast is statistically enhanced, on average, around functional Reb1 motifs that are bound as compared to nonfunctional Reb1 motifs that are unbound. The landscape of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding around functional {CTCF} motifs in human demonstrates a more complex behavior. In particular, human genomic regions characterized by the highest {CTCF} occupancy, show statistically reduced level of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding. Our findings suggest that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding is fine-tuned around functional binding sites using a variety of design strategies.},

Def1 processing results in the removal of a domain promoting cytoplasmic localization, resulting in nuclear accumulation of the clipped protein. Nuclear Def1 then binds {RNAPII,} utilizing a ubiquitin-binding domain to recruit the {Elongin-Cullin} E3 ligase complex via a {ubiquitin-homology\&\#xA0;domain} in the Ela1 protein. This facilitates polyubiquitylation of Rpb1, triggering its proteasome-mediated degradation.

  abstract={Rsp5 is a conserved ubiquitin ligase involved in regulation of numerous cellular processes. A growing number of publications describing new functions of the ligase have appeared in recent years. Rsp5 was shown to be involved in the control of intracellular trafficking of proteins via endocytosis and multivesicular body sorting. Moreover, nuclear functions of Rsp5 in response to various stresses have been discovered. Rsp5 is also involved in the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid and sterol synthesis and phospholipid composition. Here, an overview of Rsp5 functions with emphasis on its involvement in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis will be presented.}

  abstract={The continuing increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders such as {type-II} diabetes and an accelerating aging population globally will remain the major contributors to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the 21st century. It is well known that aging is highly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence also shows that obesity and metabolic diseases accelerate aging process. Studies in experimental animal models demonstrate similarity of metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes in metabolic diseases and old age, e.g. insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic low grade inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and heart failure, as well as vascular dysfunctions. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms linking metabolic stress, aging, and ultimately cardiovascular diseases are still elusive. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin {(mTOR)} signalling is a well known regulator of metabolism and lifespan in model organisms, its central role in linking metabolic stress, aging and cardiovascular diseases is recently emerging. In this article, we review the evidence supporting the role of {mTOR} signalling as a molecular interface connecting metabolic stress, aging and cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic potentials of targeting {mTOR} signalling to protect against metabolic and age-associated cardiovascular diseases are discussed.},

Despite progress in functional characterization, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of {lncRNAs} and their half-lives. Although many are easily detectable by a variety of techniques, it has been assumed that {lncRNAs} are generally unstable, but this has not been examined genome-wide. Utilizing a custom noncoding {RNA} array, we determined the half-lives of {\&\#x223C;800} {lncRNAs} and {\&\#x223C;12,000} {mRNAs} in the mouse Neuro-2a cell line. We find only a minority of {lncRNAs} are unstable. {LncRNA} half-lives vary over a wide range, comparable to, although on average less than, that of {mRNAs,} suggestive of complex metabolism and widespread functionality. Combining half-lives with comprehensive {lncRNA} annotations identified hundreds of unstable (half-life \&lt; 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic {lncRNAs,} as well as {lncRNAs} showing extreme stability (half-life \&gt; 16 h). Analysis of {lncRNA} features revealed that intergenic and cis-antisense {RNAs} are more stable than those derived from introns, as are spliced {lncRNAs} compared to unspliced (single exon) transcripts. Subcellular localization of {lncRNAs} indicated widespread trafficking to different cellular locations, with nuclear-localized {lncRNAs} more likely to be unstable. Surprisingly, one of the least stable {lncRNAs} is the well-characterized paraspeckle {RNA} Neat1, suggesting Neat1 instability contributes to the dynamic nature of this subnuclear domain. We have created an online interactive resource (http://stability.matticklab.com) that allows easy navigation of {lncRNA} and {mRNA} stability profiles and provides a comprehensive annotation of {\textasciitilde}7200 mouse {lncRNAs.}},

  abstract={In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {DGK1-encoded} diacylglycerol kinase catalyzes the {CTP-dependent} phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to form phosphatidate. This enzyme, in conjunction with {PAH1-encoded} phosphatidate phosphatase, controls the levels of phosphatidate and diacylglycerol for phospholipid synthesis, membrane growth, and lipid droplet formation. In this work, we showed that a functional level of diacylglycerol kinase is regulated by the Reb1p transcription factor. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, purified recombinant Reb1p was shown to specifically bind its consensus recognition sequence {(CGGGTAA,} -166 to -160) in the {DGK1} promoter. Analysis of cells expressing the {PDGK1-lacZ} reporter gene showed that mutations {(GT\&\#x2192;TG)} in the Reb1p-binding sequence caused an 8.6-fold reduction in {\&\#x3B2;-galactosidase} activity. The expression of {DGK1(reb1),} a {DGK1} allele containing the Reb1p-binding site mutation, was greatly lower than that of the wild type allele, as indicated by analyses of {DGK1} {mRNA,} Dgk1p, and diacylglycerol kinase activity. In the presence of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis, the dgk1\&\#x394; mutant expressing {DGK1(reb1)} exhibited a significant defect in growth as well as in the synthesis of phospholipids from triacylglycerol mobilization. Unlike {DGK1,} the {DGK1(reb1)} expressed in the dgk1\&\#x394; pah1\&\#x394; mutant did not result in the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, which occurs in cells lacking phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the Reb1p-mediated regulation of diacylglycerol kinase plays a major role in its in vivo functions in lipid metabolism.},

  abstract={In the gal-his3 hybrid promoter {his3-GG1,} the yeast upstream activator protein {GCN4} stimulates transcription when bound at the position normally occupied by the {TATA} element. This {TATA-independent} activation by {GCN4} requires two additional elements in the gal enhancer region that are distinct from those involved in normal galactose induction. Both additional elements appear to be functionally distinct from a classical {TATA} element because they cannot be replaced by the {TFIID-binding} sequence {TATAAA.} One of these elements, termed Q, is essential for {GCN4-activated} transcription and contains the sequence {GTCAC} {CCG,} which overlaps (but is distinct from) a {GAL4} binding site. Surprisingly, relatively small increases in the distance between Q and the {GCN4} binding site significantly reduce the level of transcription. The Q element specifically interacts with a yeast protein {(Q-binding} protein {[QBP])} that may be equivalent to Y, a protein that binds at a sequence that forms a constraint to nucleosome positioning. Analysis of various deletion mutants indicates that the sequence requirements for binding by {QBP} in vitro are indistinguishable from those necessary for Q activity in vivo, strongly suggesting that {QBP} is required for the function of this {TATA-independent} promoter. These results support the view that transcriptional activation can occur by an alternative mechanism in which the {TATA-binding} factor {TFIID} either is not required or is not directly bound to {DNA.} In addition, they suggest a potential role of nucleosome positioning for the activity of a promoter.}

  abstract={Using an in vitro transcription system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNA} polymerase I, we have analyzed Pol I promoter deletion mutants and mapped the boundaries of the promoter between positions -155 and +27. The 5'-boundary of the minimal core promoter capable of transcription initiation, however, was found to lie between -38 and -26. The 3'-deletion extending to -2 and -5 still allowed some transcription, suggesting that the positioning of Pol I is directed by upstream sequences. The results of in vitro analysis of linker scanning mutants {(LSMs)} combined with the deletion analysis showed that the promoter consists of three domains: two essential core domains {(I:} -28 to +8 and {II:} -76 to -51) and a transcription modulating upstream domain {(III:} -146 to -91). These results are in general agreement with those obtained in vivo (1). Using a template competition assay we also analyzed these mutant promoters for their ability to form a stable preinitiation complex. We found that the ability of 5'-deletion mutants to sequester an essential factor(s) correlates with their transcriptional activity. In contrast, several 3'-deletions and some {LSMs} in domain I and {II} decrease transcription activity greatly without significantly decreasing competition ability. The results indicate that the stimulatory function of domain {III} is achieved through its interaction with an essential transcription factor(s), although the other domains also participate in this interaction, perhaps directly or through another protein factor.}

  journal={Yeast},
  year={1994},
  abstract={We have used a random selection protocol to define the consensus and range of binding sites for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {REB1} protein. Thirty-five elements were sequenced which bound specifically to a {GST-REB1p} fusion protein coupled to {glutathione–Sepharose} under conditions in which more than 99{\textperiodcentered}9\% of the random sequences were not retained. Twenty-two of the elements contained the core sequence {CGGGTRR,} with all but one of the remaining elements containing only one deviation from the core. Of the core sequence, the only residues that were absolutely conserved were the three consecutive G residues. Statistical analysis of a nucleotide-use matrix suggested that the {REB1p} binding site also extends into flanking sequences with the optimal sequence for {REB1p} binding being {GNGCCGGGGTAACNC.} There was a positive correlation between the ability of the sites to bind in vitro and activate transcription in vivo; however, the presence of non-conformants suggests that the binding site may contribute more to transcriptional activation than simply allowing protein binding. Interestingly, one of the {REB1p} binding elements had a {DNAse} 1 footprint appreciably longer than other elements with similar affinity. Analysis of its sequence indicated the potential for a second {REB1p} binding site on the opposite strand. This suggests that two closely positioned low-affinity sites can function together as a highly active site. In addition, database searches with some of the randomly defined {REB1p} binding sites suggest that related elements are commonly found within {‘TATA-less’} promoters.},

  abstract={{RSC} and {SWI/SNF} are related {ATP-dependent} chromatin remodeling machines that move nucleosomes, regulating access to {DNA.} We addressed their roles in nucleosome phasing relative to transcription start sites in yeast. {SWI/SNF} has no effect on phasing at the global level. In contrast, {RSC} depletion results in global nucleosome re-positioning: both upstream and downstream nucleosomal arrays shift toward the nucleosome-depleted region {(NDR),} with no change in spacing, resulting in a narrower and partly filled {NDR.} The global picture of {RSC-depleted} chromatin represents the average of a range of chromatin structures, with most genes showing a shift of the +1 or the -1 nucleosome into the {NDR.} Using {RSC} {ChIP} data reported by others, we show that {RSC} occupancy is highest on the coding regions of heavily transcribed genes, though not at their {NDRs.} We propose that {RSC} has a role in restoring chromatin structure after transcription. Analysis of gene pairs in different orientations demonstrates that phasing patterns reflect competition between phasing signals emanating from neighboring {NDRs.} These signals may be in phase, resulting in constructive interference and a regular array, or out of phase, resulting in destructive interference and fuzzy positioning. We propose a modified barrier model, in which a stable complex located at the {NDR} acts as a bidirectional phasing barrier. In {RSC-depleted} cells, this barrier has a smaller footprint, resulting in narrower {NDRs.} Thus, {RSC} plays a critical role in organizing yeast chromatin.},

To screen for mutants affecting the ratio of transcription in each direction, a bidirectional fluorescent protein reporter construct was introduced into the yeast nonessential gene deletion collection. We identified chromatin assembly as an important regulator of divergent transcription. Mutations in the {CAF-I} complex caused genome-wide derepression of nascent divergent noncoding transcription. In opposition to the {CAF-I} chromatin assembly pathway, {H3K56} hyperacetylation, together with the nucleosome remodeler {SWI/SNF,} facilitated divergent transcription by promoting rapid nucleosome turnover. We propose that these chromatin-mediated effects control divergent transcription initiation, complementing downstream pathways linked to early termination and degradation of the noncoding {RNAs.}},

  abstract={Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

We observed linearity between read density and {RNA} input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control {RNAs} to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to {GC} content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to {RNA} termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control {RNAs,} we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in {RNA-seq} experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements projects {(ENCODE} and {modENCODE),} we demonstrate that external {RNA} controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of {RNA-seq} experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification.

  abstract={{Pre-mRNA} splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which can assemble on {pre-mRNA} cotranscriptionally. However, whether splicing generally occurs during transcription has not been addressed. Indeed, splicing catalysis is expected to occur posttranscriptionally in yeast, where the shortness of terminal exons should leave insufficient time for splicing. Here, we isolate endogenous S. cerevisiae nascent {RNA} and determine gene-specific splicing efficiencies and transcription profiles, using high-density tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes. Analysis of transcription profiles reveals Pol {II} pausing within the terminal exons of these genes. Intronless and inefficiently spliced genes lack this pause. In silico simulations of transcription and splicing kinetics confirm that this pausing event provides sufficient time for splicing before termination. The discovery of terminal exon pausing demonstrates functional coupling of transcription and splicing near gene ends.},

  abstract={Recent analyses have shown that the activity of the yeast nuclear exosome is stimulated by the {Trf4p-Air1/2p-Mtr4p} polyadenylation {(TRAMP)} complex. Here, we report that strains lacking the Rrp6p component of the nuclear exosome accumulate polyadenylated forms of many different ribosomal {RNA} precursors {(pre-rRNAs).} This polyadenylation is reduced in strains lacking either the {poly(A)} polymerase Trf4p or its close homologue Trf5p. In contrast, polyadenylation is enhanced by overexpression of Trf5p. Polyadenylation is also markedly increased in strains lacking the {RNA} helicase Mtr4p, indicating that it is required to couple {poly(A)} polymerase activity to degradation. Tandem affinity purification-tagged purified Trf5p showed polyadenylation activity in vitro, which was abolished by a double point mutation in the predicted catalytic site. Trf5p co-purified with Mtr4p and Air1p, indicating that it forms a complex, designated {TRAMP5,} that has functions that partially overlap with the {TRAMP} complex.},

  abstract={Trf4 is the {poly(A)} polymerase component of {TRAMP4,} which stimulates nuclear {RNA} degradation by the exosome. We report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking Trf4, cryptic transcripts are detected from regions of repressed chromatin at telomeres and the {rDNA} intergenic spacer region {(IGS1-R),} and at {CEN3.} Degradation of the {IGS1-R} transcript was reduced in strains lacking {TRAMP} components, the core exosome protein Mtr3 or the nuclear-specific exosome component Rrp6. {IGS1-R} has potential binding sites for the {RNA-binding} proteins {Nrd1/Nab3,} and was stabilized by mutation of Nrd1. {IGS1-R} passes through the replication fork barrier, a region required for {rDNA} copy number control. Strains lacking Trf4 showed sporadic changes in {rDNA} copy number, whereas loss of both Trf4 and either the histone deacetylase Sir2 or the topoisomerase Top1 caused dramatic loss of {rDNA} repeats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Trf4 is co-transcriptionally recruited to {IGS1-R,} consistent with a direct role in {rDNA} stability. Co-transcriptional {RNA} binding by Trf4 may link {RNA} and {DNA} metabolism and direct immediate {IGS1-R} degradation by the exosome following transcription termination.},

  abstract={Trf4p and Trf5p are non-canonical {poly(A)} polymerases and are part of the heteromeric protein complexes {TRAMP4} and {TRAMP5} that promote the degradation of aberrant and short-lived {RNA} substrates by interacting with the nuclear exosome. To assess the level of functional redundancy between the paralogous Trf4 and Trf5 proteins and to investigate the role of the Trf4-dependent polyadenylation in vivo, we used {DNA} microarrays to compare gene expression of the wild-type yeast strain of S. cerevisiae with either that of {trf4Delta} or {trf5Delta} mutant strains or the {trf4Delta} mutant expressing the polyadenylation-defective {Trf4(DADA)} protein. We found little overlap between the sets of transcripts with altered expression in the {trf4Delta} or the {trf5Delta} mutants, suggesting that Trf4p and Trf5p target distinct groups of {RNAs} for degradation. Surprisingly, most {RNAs} the expression of which was altered by the trf4 deletion were restored to wild-type levels by overexpression of {TRF4(DADA),} showing that the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p is dispensable in vivo. Apart from previously reported Trf4p and Trf5p target {RNAs,} this analysis along with in vivo cross-linking and {RNA} immunopurification-chip experiments revealed that both the {TRAMP4} and the {TRAMP5} complexes stimulate the degradation of spliced-out introns via a mechanism that is independent of the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p. In addition, we show that disruption of trf4 causes severe shortening of telomeres suggesting that {TRF4} functions in the maintenance of telomere length. Finally, our study demonstrates that {TRF4,} the exosome, and {TRF5} participate in antisense {RNA-mediated} regulation of genes involved in phosphate metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that paralogous {TRAMP} complexes have distinct {RNA} selectivities with functional implications in {RNA} surveillance as well as other {RNA-related} processes. This indicates widespread and integrative functions of {TRAMP} complexes for the coordination of different gene expression regulatory processes.},

During transcription {RNAs} are matured by nucleases from longer precursors and activities are also employed to exert quality control over the {RNA} synthesis process so as to discard, retain or transcriptionally silence unwanted molecules. In this review we discuss the somewhat paradoxical circumstance that the retention or turnover of {RNA} is often linked to its synthesis. This occurs via the association of chromatin, or the transcription elongation complex, with {RNA} degradation (co)factors. Although our main focus is on protein-coding genes, we also discuss mechanisms of transcription-connected turnover of non-protein-coding {RNA} from where important general principles are derived.

Rco1 and Eaf3 were subunits specific to {Rpd3S.} Mutants of {RCO1} and {EAF3} exhibited increased acetylation in the {FLO8} and {STE11} open reading frames {(ORFs)} and the appearance of aberrant transcripts initiating within the body of these {ORFs.} Mutants in the {RNA} polymerase {II-associated} {SET2} histone methyltransferase also displayed these defects. Set2 functioned upstream of {Rpd3S} and the Eaf3 methyl-histone binding chromodomain was important for recruitment of {Rpd3S} and for deacetylation within the {STE11} {ORF.} These data indicate that Pol {II-associated} Set2 methylates H3 providing a transcriptional memory which signals for deacetylation of {ORFs} by {Rpd3S.} This erases transcription elongation-associated acetylation to suppress intragenic transcription initiation.},

  abstract={Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding {RNAs.} These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, {SUTs)} or are rapidly degraded by the {RNA} surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, {CUTs).} One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of {SUTs} and {CUTs} with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of {SUTs} and {CUTs} can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated {RNAs} or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including {SUTs} and {CUTs} has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both {SUTs} and {CUTs} display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from {NFRs} at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from {NFRs} associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.},

Whether these events are coordinated and how they lead to transcription termination remains poorly understood. Here we show that {CPF} from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a Pol {II-CTD} phosphatase and that the {CPF} subunit Glc7 dephosphorylates Tyr1 in vitro. In vivo, the activity of Glc7 is required for normal Tyr1 dephosphorylation at the polyadenylation site, for recruitment of termination factors Pcf11 and Rtt103 and for normal Pol {II} termination. These results show that transcription termination involves Tyr1 dephosphorylation of the {CTD} and indicate that {pre-mRNA} processing by {CPF} and transcription termination are coupled via Glc7-dependent Pol {II-Tyr1} dephosphorylation.},

  abstract={Genetic regulatory circuits are often regarded as precise machines that accurately determine the level of expression of each protein. Most experimental technologies used to measure gene expression levels are incapable of testing and challenging this notion, as they often measure levels averaged over entire populations of cells. Yet, when expression levels are measured at the single cell level of even genetically identical cells, substantial cell-to-cell variation (or {"}noise{"}) may be observed. Sometimes different genes in a given genome may display different levels of noise; even the same gene, expressed under different environmental conditions, may display greater cell-to-cell variability in specific conditions and more tight control in other situations. While at first glance noise may seem to be an undesired property of biological networks, it might be beneficial in some cases. For instance, noise will increase functional heterogeneity in a population of microorganisms facing variable, often unpredictable, environmental changes, increasing the probability that some cells may survive the stress. In that respect, we can speculate that the population is implementing a risk distribution strategy, long before genetic heterogeneity could be acquired. Organisms may have evolved to regulate not only the averaged gene expression levels but also the extent of allowed deviations from such an average, setting it at the desired level for every gene under each specific condition. Here we review the evolving understanding of noise, its molecular underpinnings, and its effect on phenotype and fitness--when it can be detrimental, beneficial, or neutral and which regulatory tools eukaryotic cells may use to optimally control it.},

  abstract={The major function of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerase {III} is to transcribe transfer {RNA,} {5S} ribosomal {RNA,} and other small non-protein-coding {RNA} molecules. Assembly of the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex on chromosomal {DNA} requires the sequential binding of transcription factor complexes {TFIIIC} and {TFIIIB.} Recent evidence has suggested that in addition to producing {RNA} transcripts, chromatin-assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes may mediate additional nuclear functions that include chromatin boundary, nucleosome phasing, and general genome organization activities. This study provides evidence of another such {"}extratranscriptional{"} activity of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes, which is the ability to block progression of intergenic {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription. We demonstrate that the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex bound to the {tRNA} gene upstream of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {ATG31} gene protects the {ATG31} promoter against readthrough transcriptional interference from the upstream noncoding intergenic {SUT467} transcription unit. This protection is predominately mediated by binding of the {TFIIIB} complex. When {TFIIIB} binding to this {tRNA} gene is weakened, an extended {SUT467-ATG31} readthrough transcript is produced, resulting in compromised {ATG31} translation. Since the {ATG31} gene product is required for autophagy, strains expressing the readthrough transcript exhibit defective autophagy induction and reduced fitness under autophagy-inducing nitrogen starvation conditions. Given the recent discovery of widespread pervasive transcription in all forms of life, protection of neighboring genes from intergenic transcriptional interference may be a key extratranscriptional function of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes and possibly other {DNA} binding proteins.},

Depletion of Ysh1 from the nucleus does not, however, lead to readthrough transcription. In contrast, depletion of the termination factor Nrd1 leads to widespread runaway elongation of {non-pA} transcripts. Depletion of Sen1 also leads to readthrough at {non-pA} terminators, but in contrast to Nrd1, this readthrough is less processive, or more susceptible to pausing. The data presented here provide delineation of in vivo Pol {II} termination regions and highlight differences in the sequences that signal termination of different classes of {non-pA} transcripts.},

  abstract={Pervasive and hidden transcription is widespread in eukaryotes, but its global level, the mechanisms from which it originates and its functional significance are unclear. Cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} were recently described as a principal class of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the {Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP} complexes. Although {CUT} degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of {CUTs} are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of {CUTs} in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional {CUTs} and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An {RNA} fraction highly enriched in {CUTs} was analysed by a 3' {Long-SAGE} (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of {CUTs} revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of {CUTs} predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the {CUTs} start upstream from messenger {RNAs} and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new {CUTs} with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified {CUTs} corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels.},

  abstract={The regulation of protein-coding and noncoding {RNAs} is linked to nuclear processes, including chromatin modifications and gene silencing. However, the mechanisms that distinguish {RNAs} and mediate their functions are poorly understood. We describe a nuclear {RNA-processing} network in fission yeast with a core module comprising the Mtr4-like protein, Mtl1, and the zinc-finger protein, Red1. The {Mtl1-Red1} core promotes degradation of {mRNAs} and noncoding {RNAs} and associates with different proteins to assemble heterochromatin via distinct mechanisms. Mtl1 also forms Red1-independent interactions with evolutionarily conserved proteins named Nrl1 and Ctr1, which associate with splicing factors. Whereas Nrl1 targets transcripts with cryptic introns to form heterochromatin at developmental genes and retrotransposons, Ctr1 functions in processing intron-containing telomerase {RNA.} Together with our discovery of widespread cryptic introns, including in noncoding {RNAs,} these findings reveal unique cellular strategies for recognizing regulatory {RNAs} and coordinating their functions in response to developmental and environmental cues.},

  abstract={Coordinate regulation of ribosomal protein {(RP)} genes is key for controlling cell growth. In yeast, it is unclear how this regulation achieves the required equimolar amounts of the different {RP} components, given that some {RP} genes exist in duplicate copies, while others have only one copy. Here, we tested whether the solution to this challenge is partly encoded within the {DNA} sequence of the {RP} promoters, by fusing 110 different {RP} promoters to a fluorescent gene reporter, allowing us to robustly detect differences in their promoter activities that are as small as {\textasciitilde}10\%. We found that single-copy {RP} promoters have significantly higher activities, suggesting that proper {RP} stoichiometry is indeed partly encoded within the {RP} promoters. Notably, we also partially uncovered how this regulation is encoded by finding that {RP} promoters with higher activity have more nucleosome-disfavoring sequences and characteristic spatial organizations of these sequences and of binding sites for key {RP} regulators. Mutations in these elements result in a significant decrease of {RP} promoter activity. Thus, our results suggest that intrinsic {(DNA-dependent)} nucleosome organization may be a key mechanism by which genomes encode biologically meaningful promoter activities. Our approach can readily be applied to uncover how transcriptional programs of other promoters are encoded.},

  abstract={The ribosomal protein genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responsible for nearly 40\% of the polymerase {II} transcription initiation events, are characterized by the constitutive tight binding of the transcription factor Rap1. Rap1 binds at many places in the yeast genome, including glycolytic enzyme genes, the silent {MAT} loci, and telomeres, its specificity arising from specific cofactors recruited at the appropriate genes. At the ribosomal protein genes two such cofactors have recently been identified as Fhl1 and Ifh1. We have now characterized the interaction of these factors at a bidirectional ribosomal protein promoter by replacing the Rap1 sites with {LexA} operator sites. {LexA-Gal4(AD)} drives active transcription at this modified promoter, although not always at the correct initiation site. Tethering Rap1 to the promoter neither drives transcription nor recruits Fhl1 or Ifh1, showing that Rap1 function requires direct {DNA} binding. Tethering Fhl1 also fails to activate transcription, even though it does recruit Ifh1, suggesting that Fhl1 does more than simply provide a platform for Ifh1. Tethering Ifh1 to the promoter leads to low-level transcription, at the correct initiation sites. Remarkably, activation by tethered {LexA-Gal4(AD)} is strongly reduced when {TOR} kinase is inhibited by rapamycin. Thus, {TOR} can act independently of {Fhl1/Ifh1} at ribosomal protein promoters. We also show that, in our strain background, the response of ribosomal protein promoters to {TOR} inhibition is independent of the Ifh1-related protein Crf1, indicating that the role of this corepressor is strain specific. Fine-structure chromatin mapping of several ribosomal protein promoters revealed that histones are essentially absent from the Rap1 sites, while Fhl1 and Ifh1 are coincident with each other but distinct from Rap1.},

Here, we use the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the global mechanisms of two germline-enriched {cytoPAPs,} {GLD-2} and {GLD-4,} by combining polysome profiling with {RNA} sequencing. Our analyses suggest that {GLD-2} activity mediates {mRNA} stability of many translationally repressed {mRNAs.} This correlates with a general shortening of long {poly(A)} tails in gld-2-compromised animals, suggesting that most if not all targets are stabilized via robust {GLD-2-mediated} polyadenylation. By contrast, only mild polyadenylation defects are found in gld-4-compromised animals and few {mRNAs} change in abundance. Interestingly, we detect a reduced number of polysomes in gld-4 mutants and {GLD-4} protein co-sediments with polysomes, which together suggest that {GLD-4} might stimulate or maintain translation directly. Our combined data show that distinct {cytoPAPs} employ different {RNA-regulatory} mechanisms to promote gene expression, offering new insights into translational activation of {mRNAs.}},

  abstract={During gene transcription, {RNA} polymerase {(Pol)} {II} moves forwards along {DNA} and synthesizes messenger {RNA.} However, at certain {DNA} sequences, Pol {II} moves backwards, and such backtracking can arrest transcription. Arrested Pol {II} is reactivated by transcription factor {IIS} {(TFIIS),} which induces {RNA} cleavage that is required for cell viability. Pol {II} arrest and reactivation are involved in transcription through nucleosomes and in promoter-proximal gene regulation. Here we present X-ray structures at {3.3\&\#x2009;\&\#xC5;} resolution of an arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol {II} complex with {DNA} and {RNA,} and of a reactivation intermediate that additionally contains {TFIIS.} In the arrested complex, eight nucleotides of backtracked {RNA} bind a conserved 'backtrack site' in the Pol {II} pore and funnel, trapping the active centre trigger loop and inhibiting {mRNA} elongation. In the reactivation intermediate, {TFIIS} locks the trigger loop away from backtracked {RNA,} displaces {RNA} from the backtrack site, and complements the polymerase active site with a basic and two acidic residues that may catalyse proton transfers during {RNA} cleavage. The active site is demarcated from the backtrack site by a 'gating tyrosine' residue that probably delimits backtracking. These results establish the structural basis of Pol {II} backtracking, arrest and reactivation, and provide a framework for analysing gene regulation during transcription elongation.},

Functional studies demonstrate that these enzymes are part of a novel quality surveillance mechanism for {pre-mRNA} 5'-end capping. Incompletely capped {pre-mRNAs} are produced in yeast and human cells, in contrast to the general belief in the field that capping always proceeds to completion, and incomplete capping leads to defects in splicing and 3'-end cleavage in human cells.

  abstract={Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual {RNA} molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger {RNA} stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of {RNA} molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping {RNA} molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding {RNAs} and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70\% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as {RNA} abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes.},

We show that synthesis of independently transcribed {snoRNAs} involves default polyadenylation of two classes of precursors derived from termination at a main {Nrd1/Nab3-dependent} site or a {"}fail-safe{"} {mRNA-like} signal. {Poly(A)} tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative {poly(A)} polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the {exosome/Rrp6.} A more important role of {Trf4/TRAMP,} however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with {snoRNA} genes.

  abstract={Genes encoding polyadenylated {mRNAs} depend on their {poly(A)} signals for termination of transcription. An unsolved problem is how the {poly(A)} signal triggers the polymerase to terminate. A popular model is that this occurs during extrusion of the {poly(A)} signal, at which time it interacts with factors on the transcription complex. To test this idea we used cis-antisense inhibition in vivo to probe the temporal relationship between {poly(A)} signal extrusion and the commitment of the polymerase to terminate. Our rationale was to inactivate the {poly(A)} signal at increasing times post-extrusion to determine the point beyond which it is no longer required for termination. We found that communication with the polymerase is not temporally restricted to the time of {poly(A)} signal extrusion, but is ongoing and perhaps random. Some polymerases terminate almost immediately. Others have yet to receive their termination instructions from the {poly(A)} signal even 500 bp downstream, as indicated by the ability of an antisense at this distance to block termination. Thus, the {poly(A)} signal can functionally interact with the polymerase at considerable distances down the template. This is consistent with the emerging picture of a processing apparatus that assembles and matures while riding with the polymerase.},

  abstract={Proper {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} transcription termination is essential to generate stable transcripts, to prevent interference at downstream loci, and to recycle Pol {II} back to the promoter (1-3). As such, termination is an intricately controlled process that is tightly regulated by a variety of different cis- and trans-acting factors (4, 5). Although many eukaryotic termination factors have been identified to date, the details of the precise molecular mechanisms governing termination remain to be elucidated. We devised an in vitro transcription system to study specific Pol {II} termination. We show for the first time that the exonucleolytic {Rat1\&\#xB7;Rai1} complex can elicit the release of stalled Pol {II} in vitro and can do so in the absence of other factors. We also find that Rtt103, which interacts with the Pol {II} C-terminal domain {(CTD)} and with Rat1, can rescue termination activity of an exonucleolytically deficient Rat1 mutant. In light of our findings, we posit a model whereby functional nucleolytic activity is not the feature of Rat1 that ultimately promotes termination. Degradation of the nascent transcript allows Rat1 to pursue Pol {II} in a guided fashion and arrive at the site of {RNA} exit from Pol {II.} Upon this arrival, however, it is perhaps the specific and direct contact between Rat1 and Pol {II} that transmits the signal to terminate transcription.},

Surprisingly, the expression changes observed upon loss of the {CTD-Ser2} kinase Ctk1p are more similar to those derived from alterations in the {Ser5P-dependent} {NNS} pathway, than from loss of {CTD-Ser2P} binding factors. Tiling array analysis of ctk1\&\#x394; cells reveals readthrough at {snoRNAs,} at many cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} and stable uncharacterized transcripts {(SUTs),} but only at some {mRNAs.} Despite the suggested predominant role in termination of {mRNAs,} we observed that a {CTK1} deletion or a Pol {II} {CTD} mutant lacking all Ser2 positions does not result in a global {mRNA} termination defect. Rather, termination defects in these strains are widely observed at {NNS-dependent} genes. These results indicate that Ctk1p and Ser2 {CTD} phosphorylation have a wide impact in termination of small non-coding {RNAs} but only affect a subset of {mRNA} coding genes.},

  abstract={The universal {pre-mRNA} processing events of 5' end capping, splicing, and 3' end formation by cleavage/polyadenylation occur co-transcriptionally. As a result, the substrate for {mRNA} processing factors is a nascent {RNA} chain that is being extruded from the {RNA} polymerase {II} exit channel at 10-30 bases per second. How do processing factors find their substrate {RNAs} and complete most {mRNA} maturation before transcription is finished? Recent studies suggest that this task is facilitated by a combination of {protein-RNA} and protein-protein interactions within a {'mRNA} factory' that comprises the elongating {RNA} polymerase and associated processing factors. This 'factory' undergoes dynamic changes in composition as it traverses a gene and provides the setting for regulatory interactions that couple processing to transcriptional elongation and termination.},

The yeast Ctk1 kinase associates with elongation complexes and phosphorylates serine 2 in the {YSPTSPS} repeats of the Rpb1 C-terminal domain, a modification that couples transcription to {mRNA} 3'-end processing. The higher eukaryotic kinase Cdk9 not only performs a similar function, but also functions at the 5'-end of genes in the transition from initiation to elongation. In strains lacking Ctk1, many basal transcription factors cross-link throughout transcribed regions, apparently remaining associated with {RNApII} until it terminates. Consistent with this observation, preinitiation complexes formed on immobilized templates with transcription extracts lacking Ctk1 leave lower levels of the scaffold complex behind after escape. Taken together, these results suggest that Ctk1 is necessary for the release of {RNApII} from basal transcription factors. Interestingly, this function of Ctk1 is independent of its kinase activity, suggesting a structural function of the protein.},

The {CTD} kinases Kin28 and Ctk1 markedly affect Pol {II} distribution in a gene-specific way. The code is therefore written differently on different genes, probably under the control of promoters. Ser7 phosphorylation is enriched on introns and at sites of Nrd1 accumulation, suggesting links to splicing and Nrd1 recruitment. Nrd1 and Pcf11 frequently colocalize, suggesting functional overlap.

Known alternative 3'-processing sites, both within the 3'-untranslated region and within the protein coding sequence were successfully identified, leading to the possibility of prediction of previously unknown alternative sites.

  abstract={We have devised a cis-antisense rescue assay of cleavage and polyadenylation to determine how long it takes the simian virus 40 {(SV40)} early {poly(A)} signal to commit itself to processing in vivo. An inverted copy of the {poly(A)} signal placed immediately downstream of the authentic one inhibited processing by means of sense-antisense duplex formation in the {RNA.} The antisense inhibition was gradually relieved when the inverted signal was moved increasing distances downstream, presumably because cleavage and polyadenylation occur before the polymerase reaches the antisense sequence. Antisense inhibition was unaffected when the inverted signal was moved upstream. Based on the known rate of transcription, we estimate that the cleavage-polyadenylation process takes between 10 and 20 s for the {SV40} early {poly(A)} site to complete in vivo. Relief from inhibition occurred earlier for shorter antisense sequences than for longer ones. This indicates that a brief period of assembly is sufficient for the {poly(A)} signal to shield itself from a short (50- to 70-nucleotide) antisense sequence but that more assembly time is required for the signal to become immune to the longer ones (approximately 200 nucleotides). The simplest explanation for this target size effect is that the assembly process progressively sequesters more and more of the {RNA} surrounding the {poly(A)} signal up to a maximum of about 200 nucleotides, which we infer to be the domain of the mature apparatus. We compared strong and weak {poly(A)} sites. The {SV40} late {poly(A)} site, one of the strongest, assembles several times faster than the weaker {SV40} early or synthetic {poly(A)} site.}

  abstract={Biological processes are not exempt from errors and {RNA} production is not an exception to this rule. Errors can arise stochastically or be genetically fixed and systematically appear in the biochemical or cellular phenotype. In any case, quality control mechanisms are essential to minimize the potentially toxic effects of faulty {RNA} production or processing. Although many {RNA} molecules express their functional potential in the cytoplasm, as messengers, adaptors or operators of gene expression pathways, a large share of quality control occurs in the nucleus. This is likely because the early timing of occurrence and the subcellular partition make the control more efficient, at least as long as the defects can be detected ahead of the cytoplasmic phase of the {RNA} life cycle. One crucial point in discussing {RNA} quality control resides in its definition. A stringent take would imply the existence of specific mechanisms to recognize the error and the consequent repair or elimination of the faulty molecule. One example in the {RNA} field could be the recognition of a premature stop codon by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, discussed elsewhere in this issue. A more relaxed view posits that the thermodynamic or kinetic aftermath of a mistake (e.g. a blockage or a delay in processing) by itself constitutes the recognition event, which triggers downstream quality control. Because whether inappropriate molecules are specifically recognized remains unclear in many cases, we will adopt the more relaxed definition of {RNA} quality control. {RNA} repair remains episodic and the degradative elimination of crippled molecules appears to be the rule. Therefore we will briefly describe the actors of {RNA} degradation in the nucleus. Detailed analyses of the mechanism of action of these enzymes can be found in several excellent and recent reviews, including in this issue. Finally, we will restrict our analysis to the yeast model, which is used in the majority of {RNA} quality control studies, but examples exist in the literature indicating that many of the principles of {RNA} quality control described in yeast also apply to other eukaryotes.

Ler sequence was used to confirm 117 of 121 {SFPs} and to determine the sensitivity of array hybridization. Features containing sequence repeats, as well as those from high copy genes, showed greater polymorphism rates. A linear clustering algorithm was developed to identify clusters of {SFPs} representing potential deletions in 111 genes at a 5\% false discovery rate {(FDR).} Among the potential deletions were transposons, disease resistance genes, and genes involved in secondary metabolism. The applicability of this technique was demonstrated by genotyping a recombinant inbred line. Recombination break points could be clearly defined, and in one case delimited to an interval of 29 kb. We further demonstrate that array hybridization can be combined with bulk segregant analysis to quickly map mutations. The extension of these tools to organisms with complex genomes, such as Arabidopsis, will greatly increase our ability to map and clone quantitative trait loci {(QTL).}},

We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe {(PM} and {MM)} values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference {(AvDiff)} and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index {(MBEI).} The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average {(RMA)} of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA)} model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error {(SE)} to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

We describe here an additional mechanism of transcription termination for {RNAPII} and demonstrate its biological significance.

Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (\&lt;1000 bp) {RNAPII} transcripts such as small noncoding {RNAs} {(snRNAs),} cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs),} and some stable unannotated transcripts {(SUTs)} that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 {(NNS)} dependent mechanism. {NNS-dependent} termination is coupled to {RNA} 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of {ncRNA} transcripts including {CUTs.} To determine the role of Rrp6 in {NNS} termination globally, we performed {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} on total {RNA} and perform {ChIP-exo} analysis of {RNA} Polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} localization. Deletion of {RRP6} promotes hyper-elongation of multiple {NNS-dependent} transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' {RNA} ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in {RNAPII} termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in {mRNA} expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known {NNS} targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at {CUTs.} Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the {NNS} complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end {RNA} processing and/or degradation at specific targets.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotes initiates at specific sites known as origins of replication, or replicators. These replication origins occur throughout the genome, though the propensity of their occurrence depends on the type of organism. In eukaryotes, zones of initiation of replication spanning from about 100 to 50,000 base pairs have been reported. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where some autonomously replicating sequences, or {ARS} elements, confer origin activity. {ARS} elements are short {DNA} sequences of a few hundred base pairs, identified by their efficiency at initiating a replication event when cloned in a plasmid. {ARS} elements, although structurally diverse, maintain a basic structure composed of three domains, A, B and C. Domain A is comprised of a consensus sequence designated {ACS} {(ARS} consensus sequence), while the B domain has the {DNA} unwinding element and the C domain is important for {DNA-protein} interactions. Although there are {\&\#x223C;400\&\#xA0;ARS} elements in the yeast genome, not all of them are active origins of replication. Different groups within the genus Saccharomyces have {ARS} elements as components of replication origin. The present paper provides a comprehensive review of various aspects of {ARSs,} starting from their structural conservation to sequence thermodynamics. All significant and conserved functional sequence motifs within different types of {ARS} elements have been extensively described. Issues like silencing at {ARSs,} their inherent fragility and factors governing their replication efficiency have also been addressed. Progress in understanding crucial components associated with the replication machinery and timing at these {ARS} elements is discussed in the section entitled {{"}The} replicon revisited{"}.},

  abstract={Replication origins in a genome are inherently different in their base sequence and in their response to temporal and cell cycle regulation signals for {DNA} replication. To investigate the chromosomal determinants that influence the efficiency of initiation of {DNA} replication genome-wide, we made use of a reverse strategy originally used for the isolation of replication initiation mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, replication origins isolated from chromosomes support the autonomous replication of plasmids. These replication origins, whether in the context of a chromosome or a plasmid, will initiate efficiently in wild-type cells but show a dramatically contrasted efficiency of activation in mutants defective in the early steps of replication initiation. Serial passages of a genomic library of autonomously replicating sequences {(ARSs)} in such a mutant allowed us to select for constitutively active {ARSs.} We found a hierarchy of preferential initiation of {ARSs} that correlates with local transcription patterns. This preferential usage is enhanced in mutants defective in the assembly of the prereplication complex {(pre-RC)} but not in mutants defective in the activation of the {pre-RC.} Our findings are consistent with an interference of local transcription with the assembly of the {pre-RC} at a majority of replication origins.},

We demonstrate that interpreting high-resolution Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome replication data with a mathematical model allows quantification of the stochastic nature of genome replication, including the efficiency of each origin and the distribution of termination events. Single-cell measurements support the inferred values for stochastic origin activation time. A strain, in which three origins were inactivated, confirmed that the distribution of termination events is primarily dictated by the stochastic activation time of origins. Cell-to-cell variability in origin activity ensures that termination events are widely distributed across virtually the whole genome. We propose that the heterogeneity in origin usage contributes to genome stability by limiting potentially deleterious events from accumulating at particular loci.},

Moreover, after the release of Pol {II} from the promoter-proximal region, elongation rates are highly dynamic throughout the transcription of a gene, and vary on a gene-by-gene basis. Interestingly, Pol {II} elongation rates affect co-transcriptional processes such as splicing, termination and genome stability. Increasing numbers of factors and regulatory mechanisms have been associated with the steps of transcription elongation by Pol {II,} revealing that elongation is a highly complex process. Elongation is thus now recognized as a key phase in the regulation of transcription by Pol {II.}},

  abstract={All chromosomes must be completely replicated prior to cell division, a requirement that demands the activation of a sufficient number of appropriately distributed {DNA} replication origins. Here we investigate how the activity of multiple origins on each chromosome is coordinated to ensure successful replication. We present a stochastic model for whole chromosome replication where the dynamics are based upon the parameters of individual origins. Using this model we demonstrate that mean replication time at any given chromosome position is determined collectively by the parameters of all origins. Combining parameter estimation with extensive simulations we show that there is a range of model parameters consistent with mean replication data, emphasising the need for caution in interpreting such data. In contrast, the replicated-fraction at time points through S phase contains more information than mean replication time data and allowed us to use our model to uniquely estimate many origin parameters. These estimated parameters enable us to make a number of predictions that showed agreement with independent experimental data, confirming that our model has predictive power. In summary, we demonstrate that a stochastic model can recapitulate experimental observations, including those that might be interpreted as deterministic such as ordered origin activation times.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication origins are necessary for the duplication of genomes. In addition, plasmid-based expression systems require {DNA} replication origins to maintain plasmids efficiently. The yeast autonomously replicating sequence {(ARS)} assay has been a valuable tool in dissecting replication origin structure and function. However, the dearth of information on origins in diverse yeasts limits the availability of efficient replication origin modules to only a handful of species and restricts our understanding of origin function and evolution. To enable rapid study of origins, we have developed a sequencing-based suite of methods for comprehensively mapping and characterizing {ARSs} within a yeast genome. Our approach finely maps genomic inserts capable of supporting plasmid replication and uses massively parallel deep mutational scanning to define molecular determinants of {ARS} function with single-nucleotide resolution. In addition to providing unprecedented detail into origin structure, our data have allowed us to design short, synthetic {DNA} sequences that retain maximal {ARS} function. These methods can be readily applied to understand and modulate {ARS} function in diverse systems.},

These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)} sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in {MNase} protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of {DNA} contacts around {H4S47} is accompanied by protection of the {DNA} from {MNase.} Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the {RSC} chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions.

  abstract={Abstract The increasing availability of {ChIP-seq} data demands for advanced statistical tools to analyze the results of such experiments. The inherent features of high-throughput sequencing output call for a modelling framework that can account for the spatial dependency between neighboring regions of the genome and the temporal dimension that arises from observing the protein binding process at progressing time points; also, multiple biological/technical replicates of the experiment are usually produced and methods to jointly account for them are needed. Furthermore, the antibodies used in the experiment lead to potentially different immunoprecipitation efficiencies, which can affect the capability of distinguishing between the true signal in the data and the background noise. The statistical procedure proposed consist of a discrete mixture model with an underlying latent Markov random field: the novelty of the model is to allow both spatial and temporal dependency to play a role in determining the latent state of genomic regions involved in the protein binding process, while combining all the information of the replicates available instead of treating them separately. It is also possible to take into account the different antibodies used, in order to obtain better insights of the process and exploit all the biological information available.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic cells initiate {DNA} replication from multiple origins, which must be tightly regulated to promote precise genome duplication in every cell cycle.

Here we describe the reconstitution of budding yeast {DNA} replication initiation with 16 purified replication factors, made from 42 polypeptides. Origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation seen in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase {(CDK)} inhibits {MCM} loading by phosphorylating the origin recognition complex {(ORC)} and promotes {CMG} formation by phosphorylating Sld2 and Sld3. Dbf4-dependent kinase {(DDK)} promotes replication by phosphorylating {MCM,} and can act either before or after {CDK.} These experiments define the minimum complement of proteins, protein kinase substrates and co-factors required for regulated eukaryotic {DNA} replication.},

  abstract={{RNA-Sequencing} {(RNA-Seq)} has been widely adopted for quantifying gene expression changes in comparative transcriptome analysis. For detecting differentially expressed genes, a variety of statistical methods based on the negative binomial {(NB)} distribution have been proposed. These methods differ in the ways they handle the {NB} nuisance parameters (i.e., the dispersion parameters associated with each gene) to save power, such as by using a dispersion model to exploit an apparent relationship between the dispersion parameter and the {NB} mean. Presumably, dispersion models with fewer parameters will result in greater power if the models are correct, but will produce misleading conclusions if not. This paper investigates this power and robustness trade-off by assessing rates of identifying true differential expression using the various methods under realistic assumptions about {NB} dispersion parameters. Our results indicate that the relative performances of the different methods are closely related to the level of dispersion variation unexplained by the dispersion model. We propose a simple statistic to quantify the level of residual dispersion variation from a fitted dispersion model and show that the magnitude of this statistic gives hints about whether and how much we can gain statistical power by a dispersion-modeling approach.},

Thioredoxin-1 {(Trx-1)} is a redox regulating protein and is induced under various stresses. Our previous study has shown that epinephrine induces the expression of Trx-1. Tyrosine hydroxylase {(TH)} is the major rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis in response to stress. However, how {TH} is regulated by epinephrine is still unknown. In the present study, we found that epinephrine increased the expression of {TH} in a dose- and time-dependent manner in {PC12} cells, which was inhibited by propranolol {(\&\#x3B2;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor), but not by phenoxybenzamine {(\&\#x3B1;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor). The increase of {TH} was also inhibited by {SQ22536} (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor), {H-89(PKA} inhibitor) and {LY294002} (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor). More importantly, overexpression of Trx-1 significantly enhanced the expression of {TH,} while Trx-1 {siRNA} suppressed {TH} expression induced by epinephrine. These results suggest that Trx-1 is involved in {TH} expression induced by epinephrine in {PC12} cells.},

  abstract={Genetic information stored in {DNA} is accurately copied and transferred to subsequent generations through {DNA} replication. This process is accomplished through the concerted actions of highly conserved {DNA} replication components. Epigenetic information stored in the form of histone modifications and {DNA} methylation, constitutes a second layer of regulatory information important for many cellular processes, such as gene expression regulation, chromatin organization, and genome stability. During {DNA} replication, epigenetic information must also be faithfully transmitted to subsequent generations. How this monumental task is achieved remains poorly understood. In this review, we will discuss recent advances on the role of {DNA} replication components in the inheritance of epigenetic marks, with a particular focus on epigenetic regulation in fission yeast. Based on these findings, we propose that specific {DNA} replication components function as key regulators in the replication of epigenetic information across the genome.},

  abstract={The past decades have witnessed a surge of discoveries revealing {RNA} regulation as a central player in cellular processes. {RNAs} are regulated by {RNA-binding} proteins {(RBPs)} at all post-transcriptional stages, including splicing, transportation, stabilization and translation. Defects in the functions of these {RBPs} underlie a broad spectrum of human pathologies. Systematic identification of {RBP} functional targets is among the key biomedical research questions and provides a new direction for drug discovery. The advent of cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (genome-wide {CLIP)} technology has recently enabled the investigation of genome-wide {RBP-RNA} binding at single base-pair resolution. This technology has evolved through the development of three distinct versions: {HITS-CLIP,} {PAR-CLIP} and {iCLIP.} Meanwhile, numerous bioinformatics pipelines for handling the genome-wide {CLIP} data have also been developed. In this review, we discuss the genome-wide {CLIP} technology and focus on bioinformatics analysis. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the scopes, of various bioinformatics tools. To assist readers in choosing optimal procedures for their analysis, we also review experimental design and procedures that affect bioinformatics analyses.},

The crucial point of our analysis was devising a method that allows the accurate determination of the immunoprecipitation efficiency for each protein. We achieved this by spiking every immunoprecipitation reaction with the formaldehyde cross-linked in vitro counterparts of {TFIIIB-,} {TFIIIC-,} and pol {III-DNA} complexes, measuring the in vitro occupancies of the corresponding factors on a {DNA} probe and determining probe recovery by quantitative {PCR.} Analysis of nine pol {III-transcribed} genes with diverse sequence characteristics showed a very high occupancy by {TFIIIB} and pol {III} (pol {III} occupancy being generally approximately 70\% of {TFIIIB} occupancy) and a {TFIIIC} occupancy that ranged between approximately 5 and 25\%. Current data suggest that {TFIIIC} is released during transcription in vitro, and it has been proposed that {TFIIIB} suffices for pol {III} recruitment in vivo. Our findings point to the transient nature of the {TFIIIC-DNA} interaction in vivo, with no significant counter-correlation between pol {III} and {TFIIIC} occupancy and instead to a dependence of {TFIIIB-DNA} and {TFIIIC-DNA} complex maintenance in vivo on pol {III} function.},

  abstract={{DNA} sequences with high affinity for transcription factors occur more frequently in the genome than instances of genes bound or regulated by these factors. It is not clear what factors determine the genome-wide pattern of binding or regulation for a given transcription factor. We used an integrated approach to study how trans influences shape the binding and regulatory landscape of Pho4, a budding yeast transcription factor activated in response to phosphate limitation. We find that nucleosomes significantly restrict Pho4 binding. At nucleosome-depleted sites, competition from another transcription factor, Cbf1, determines Pho4 occupancy, raising the threshold for transcriptional activation in phosphate replete conditions and preventing Pho4 activation of genes outside the phosphate regulon during phosphate starvation. Pho4 binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation-a cooperative interaction between Pho2 and Pho4 specifies genes that are activated. Combining these experimental observations, we are able to globally predict Pho4 binding and its functionality.},

We sequenced {RNA} from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International {HapMap} Project.

Using the genotypes from the {HapMap} project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that {eQTLs} near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

  abstract={Cardiac modelling is the area of physiome modelling where the available simulation software is perhaps most mature, and it therefore provides an excellent starting point for considering the software requirements for the wider physiome community. In this paper, we will begin by introducing some of the most advanced existing software packages for simulating cardiac electrical activity. We consider the software development methods used in producing codes of this type, and discuss their use of numerical algorithms, relative computational efficiency, usability, robustness and extensibility. We then go on to describe a class of software development methodologies known as test-driven agile methods and argue that such methods are more suitable for scientific software development than the traditional academic approaches. A case study is a project of our own, Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment, which is a library of computational biology software that began as an experiment in the use of agile programming methods. We present our experiences with a review of our progress thus far, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared with the development methods used in some existing packages. We conclude by considering whether the likely wider needs of the cardiac modelling community are currently being met and suggest that, in order to respond effectively to changing requirements, it is essential that these codes should be more malleable. Such codes will allow for reliable extensions to include both detailed mathematical models--of the heart and other organs--and more efficient numerical techniques that are currently being developed by many research groups worldwide.},

  abstract={{RNA} chain elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} is a complex and regulated process which is coordinated with capping, splicing, and polyadenylation of the primary transcript. Numerous elongation factors that enable pol {II} to transcribe faster and/or more efficiently have been purified. {SII} is one such factor. It helps pol {II} bypass specific blocks to elongation that are encountered during transcript elongation. {SII} was first identified biochemically on the basis of its ability to enable pol {II} to synthesize long transcripts. ((1)) Both the high resolution structure of {SII} and the details of its novel mechanism of action have been refined through mutagenesis and sophisticated in vitro assays. {SII} engages transcribing pol {II} and assists it in bypassing blocks to elongation by stimulating a cryptic, nascent {RNA} cleavage activity intrinsic to {RNA} polymerase. The nuclease activity can also result in removal of misincorporated bases from {RNA.} Molecular genetic experiments in yeast suggest that {SII} is generally involved in {mRNA} synthesis in vivo and that it is one type of a growing collection of elongation factors that regulate pol {II.} In vertebrates, a family of related {SII} genes has been identified; some of its members are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The principal challenge now is to understand the isoform-specific functional differences and the biology of regulation exerted by the {SII} family of proteins on target genes, particularly in multicellular organisms.},

In the present work, we show that loss of the Drosophila tcs3 homolog also leads to a severe reduction in size and demonstrate, for the first time in a non-microbe, that Tcs3 is required for {t(6)A} synthesis. In Drosophila and in mammals, {tRNAi} {(Met)} is a limiting factor for cell and animal growth. We report that the {t(6)A-modified} form of {tRNAi} {(Met)} is the actual limiting factor. We show that changing the proportion of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNAi} {(Met),} by expression of an un-modifiable {tRNAi} {(Met)} or changing the levels of Tcs3, regulate target of rapamycin {(TOR)} kinase activity and influences cell and animal growth in vivo. These findings reveal an unprecedented relationship between the translation machinery and {TOR,} where translation efficiency, limited by the availability of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNA,} determines growth potential in eukaryotic cells.},

In contrast, transcription and translation inhibitors did not decrease {phospho-Ser2} level, therefore inhibition of not all the gene expression processes cause the decrease of {phospho-Ser2.} {SSA} treatment caused early dissociation of Pol {II} and decrease in {phospho-Ser2} level of chromatin-bound Pol {II,} suggesting that splicing inhibition causes downregulation of {phospho-Ser2} through at least these two mechanisms.},

Despite the fact that a variety of factors or 'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data, commonly used {RNA-seq} normalization methods only correct for sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the data, more recently developed {RNA-seq} normalization can. We focus on one particular method, {RUVSeq} and show that it is able to increase power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of {RUVSeq} normalization that is applicable to a broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.},

  abstract={In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential nuclear helicase Sen1 is required for efficient termination of transcription of short non-coding {RNA} genes by {RNA} polymerase {II.} However, the mechanism by which Sen1 promotes transcription termination is not known. Prior biochemical studies on the Sen1 homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that it can bind and unwind both {DNA} and {RNA,} but the S. pombe protein is not essential and has not been demonstrated to function in transcription. Furthermore, Sen1 from either yeast has not previously been expressed as recombinant protein, due to its large molecular mass (252 {kDa} in S. cerevisiae). Here we report the purification and characterization of the 89 {kDa} S. cerevisiae Sen1 helicase domain {(Sen1-HD)} produced in E. coli. {Sen1-HD} binds single-stranded {RNA} and {DNA} with similar affinity in the absence of {ATP,} but binds {RNA} more stably than {DNA} in the presence of {ATP,} apparently due to a slower translocation rate on {RNA.} Translocation occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, as for the S. pombe protein. When purified from E. coli at moderate salt concentration, {Sen1-HD} was associated with short {RNAs} that are enriched for the tri-nucleotide repeat {(CAN)4.} We propose that Sen1 binds to {RNAs} and prevents their stable pairing with {DNA,} consistent with in vivo studies by others showing increased R-loop {(RNA/DNA} hybrid) formation when Sen1 activity is impaired by mutations. Our results are consistent with a model in which Sen1 promotes transcription termination by resolving R-loops.},

Gene order analyses around {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} centromeres indicate their unique, and separate, evolutionary origin. Nevertheless, they are still bound by the ortholog of the {CBF3} complex, which recognizes {CDEs} in other point centromeres. The new type of point centromere originated prior to the divergence between {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} and its close relative Naumovozyma dairenensis and disseminated to all {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} chromosomes through extensive genome rearrangement. Thus, contrary to the conventional view, point centromeres can undergo rapid evolutionary changes. These findings give new insights into the evolution of point centromeres.},

  abstract={Genes from yeast to mammals are frequently subject to non-coding transcription of their antisense strand; however the genome-wide role for antisense transcription remains elusive. As transcription influences chromatin structure, we took a genome-wide approach to assess which chromatin features are associated with nascent antisense transcription, and contrast these with features associated with nascent sense transcription. We describe a distinct chromatin architecture at the promoter and gene body specifically associated with antisense transcription, marked by reduced {H2B} ubiquitination, {H3K36} and {H3K79} trimethylation and increased levels of H3 acetylation, chromatin remodelling enzymes, histone chaperones and histone turnover. The difference in sense transcription between genes with high or low levels of antisense transcription is slight; thus the antisense transcription-associated chromatin state is not simply analogous to a repressed state. Using mutants in which the level of antisense transcription is reduced at {GAL1,} or altered genome-wide, we show that non-coding transcription is associated with high H3 acetylation and H3 levels across the gene, while reducing {H3K36me3.} Set1 is required for these antisense transcription-associated chromatin changes in the gene body. We propose that nascent antisense and sense transcription have fundamentally distinct relationships with chromatin, and that both should be considered canonical features of eukaryotic genes.},

Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the {"}secondary channel{"} is the only route for {NTP} to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the {"}main channel{"} could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol {II} have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template {DNA} part of the full transcription bubble {(TB)} is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate through the main channel might overlap with the {TB} region, gaining structural information of the full {TB} is critical for a complete understanding of Pol {II} transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol {II} with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics {(MD)} simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on {NTP} entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow {NTP} loading, the percentage of {MD} conformations containing enough space for {NTP} loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on {MD} simulations with {NTP} loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the {NTP} through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the {NTP} and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template {DNA} strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for {NTP} entry during Pol {II} transcription.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotes is strictly regulated by several mechanisms. A central step in this replication is the assembly of the heterohexameric minichromosome maintenance {(MCM2-7)} helicase complex at replication origins during G1 phase as an inactive double hexamer. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we report a near-atomic structure of the {MCM2-7} double hexamer purified from yeast G1 chromatin. Our structure shows that two single hexamers, arranged in a tilted and twisted fashion through interdigitated amino-terminal domain interactions, form a kinked central channel. Four constricted rings consisting of conserved interior {\&\#x3B2;-hairpins} from the two single hexamers create a narrow passageway that tightly fits duplex {DNA.} This narrow passageway, reinforced by the offset of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer interface, is flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, {MCM2} and {MCM5.} These unusual features of the twisted and tilted single hexamers suggest a concerted mechanism for the melting of origin {DNA} that requires structural deformation of the intervening {DNA.}},

Early reports indicate that {5fC} and {5caC} could be stably detected on enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, with distinct effects on gene expression, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we determined the X-ray crystal structure of yeast elongating {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} in complex with a {DNA} template containing oxidized {5mCs,} revealing specific hydrogen bonds between the 5-carboxyl group of {5caC} and the conserved {epi-DNA} recognition loop in the polymerase. This causes a positional shift for incoming nucleoside 5'-triphosphate {(NTP),} thus compromising nucleotide addition. To test the implication of this structural insight in vivo, we determined the global effect of increased {5fC/5caC} levels on transcription, finding that such {DNA} modifications indeed retarded Pol {II} elongation on gene bodies. These results demonstrate the functional impact of oxidized {5mCs} on gene expression and suggest a novel role for Pol {II} as a specific and direct epigenetic sensor during transcription elongation.},

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis {(PCA)} are common approaches for dealing with this onslaught. Though these unsupervised techniques can help uncover interesting structure in high-dimensional data they give little insight into the biological and technical considerations that might explain the uncovered structure. Here we introduce a hybrid approach-component selection using mutual information {(CSUMI)-that} uses a mutual information-based statistic to reinterpret the results of {PCA} in a biologically meaningful way. We apply {CSUMI} to {RNA-seq} data from {GTEx.} Our hybrid approach enables us to unveil the previously hidden relationship between principal components {(PCs)} and the underlying biological and technical sources of variation across samples. In particular, we look at how tissue type affects {PCs} beyond the first two, allowing us to devise a principled way of choosing which {PCs} to consider when exploring the data. We further apply our method to {RNA-seq} data taken from the brain and show that some of the most biologically informative {PCs} are higher-dimensional {PCs;} for instance, {PC} 5 can differentiate the basal ganglia from other tissues. We also use {CSUMI} to explore how technical artifacts affect the global structure of the data, validating previous results and demonstrating how our method can be viewed as a verification framework for detecting undiscovered biases in emerging technologies. Finally we compare {CSUMI} to two correlation-based approaches, showing ours outperforms both. A python implementation is available online on the {CSUMI} website.},

We propose a computational approach for designing a starting pool of {RNA} sequences for the selection of {RNA} aptamers for specific analyte binding. Our approach consists of three steps: (i) selection of {RNA} sequences based on their secondary structure, (ii) generating a library of three-dimensional {(3D)} structures of {RNA} molecules and (iii) high-throughput virtual screening of this library to select aptamers with binding affinity to a desired small molecule. We developed a set of criteria that allows one to select a sequence with potential binding affinity from a pool of random sequences and developed a protocol for {RNA} {3D} structure prediction. As verification, we tested the performance of in silico selection on a set of six known aptamer-ligand complexes. The structures of the native sequences for the ligands in the testing set were among the top 5\% of the selected structures. The proposed approach reduces the {RNA} sequences search space by four to five orders of magnitude--significantly accelerating the experimental screening and selection of high-affinity aptamers.},

  abstract={Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment {(SELEX)} is an important technology in combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology of developing high affinity target-binding molecules (aptamers) from highly complex nucleic acid ligand libraries. Schematically, the {SELEX} is a series of iterative rounds of operations where in each operational round ligands are incubated with the target (e.g., a purified protein), and target-binding ligands are extracted and amplified. In the recent development of biological study and drug discovery, by incubating ligand libraries with complex target mixtures (e.g., cell fragments), the {SELEX} experiments have been explored to simultaneously develop aptamers for targets embedded in target mixtures: the complex {SELEX.} While holding the considerable advantages of saving experimental resources, practicing the complex {SELEX} has often accompanied with unstable experimental performances. It is therefore important to understand the behaviors of the new application. In this paper, we develop stochastic computer model, and customized computational algorithm to numerically mimic the complex {SELEX.} We model the ligand selection through the probability of ligand binding to complex targets at the binding equilibrium, and efficiency of separating target-binders for amplification. The customized computational algorithm allows us to simulate real experiments that operate on huge ligand libraries. We evaluate the ligand evolution, and aptamer enrichment of complex {SELEX} under various experimental conditions by stochastic simulations, and theorize the simulated results. We argue that the stochastic effects, which were not previously captured in the studies of complex {SELEX,} may significantly affect the results of experiments.},

  abstract={Non-coding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)} play critical roles in gene regulation. In eukaryotic cells, {ncRNAs} are processed and/or degraded by the nuclear exosome, a ribonuclease complex containing catalytic subunits Dis3 and Rrp6. The {TRAMP} {(Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4} polyadenylation) complex is a critical exosome cofactor in budding yeast that stimulates the exosome to process/degrade {ncRNAs} and human {TRAMP} components have recently been identified. Importantly, mutations in exosome and exosome cofactor genes cause neurodegenerative disease. How the {TRAMP} complex interacts with other exosome cofactors to orchestrate regulation of the exosome is an open question. To identify novel interactions of the {TRAMP} exosome cofactor, we performed a high copy suppressor screen of a thermosensitive air1/2 {TRAMP} mutant. Here, we report that the Nab3 {RNA-binding} protein of the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} complex is a potent suppressor of {TRAMP} mutants. Unlike Nab3, Nrd1 and Sen1 do not suppress {TRAMP} mutants and Nrd1 binding is not required for Nab3-mediated suppression of {TRAMP} suggesting an independent role for Nab3. Critically, Nab3 decreases {ncRNA} levels in {TRAMP} mutants, Nab3-mediated suppression of air1/2 cells requires the nuclear exosome component, Rrp6, and Nab3 directly binds Rrp6. We extend this analysis to identify a human {RNA} binding protein, {RALY,} which shares identity with Nab3 and can suppress {TRAMP} mutants. These results suggest that Nab3 facilitates {TRAMP} function by recruiting Rrp6 to {ncRNAs} for processing/degradation independent of Nrd1. The data raise the intriguing possibility that Nab3 and Nrd1 can function independently to recruit Rrp6 to {ncRNA} targets, providing combinatorial flexibility in {RNA} processing.},

  abstract={The {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription cycle is often divided into three major stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Research over the last decade has blurred these divisions and emphasized the tightly regulated transitions that occur as {RNA} polymerase {II} synthesizes a transcript from start to finish. Transcription termination, the process that marks the end of transcription elongation, is regulated by proteins that interact with the polymerase, nascent transcript, and/or chromatin template. The failure to terminate transcription can cause accumulation of aberrant transcripts and interfere with transcription at downstream genes. Here, we review the mechanism, regulation, and physiological impact of a termination pathway that targets small noncoding transcripts produced by {RNA} polymerase {II.} We emphasize the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} pathway in yeast, in which the process has been extensively studied. The importance of understanding small {RNA} termination pathways is underscored by the need to control noncoding transcription in eukaryotic genomes.},

This low complexity region of Nab3 appears intrinsically unstructured and can form a hydrogel in vitro. These data support a model in which multiple {Nrd1-Nab3} heterodimers polymerize onto substrate {RNA} to effect termination, allowing complementation of one mutant Nab3 molecule by another lacking a different function. The self-association property of Nab3 adds to the previously documented interactions between these {hnRNP-like} proteins, {RNA} polymerase {II,} and the nascent transcript, leading to a network of nucleoprotein interactions that define a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex. This was underscored from the synthetic phenotypes of yeast strains with pairwise combinations of Nrd1 and Nab3 mutations known to affect their distinct biochemical activities. The mutations included a Nab3 self-association defect, a {Nab3-Nrd1} heterodimerization defect, a Nrd1-polymerase {II} binding defect, and an {Nab3-RNA} recognition motif mutation. Although no single mutation was lethal, cells with any two mutations were not viable for four such pairings, and a fifth displayed a synthetic growth defect. These data strengthen the idea that a multiplicity of interactions is needed to assemble a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex that coats specific nascent {RNAs} in preparation for termination.},

To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription {factor-DNA} interactions to quantitatively model {SELEX.} We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor {CTF/NFI.} From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

  abstract={Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential {(SELEX)} is a revolutionary technology that integrates combinatorial chemistry with high throughput screening to generate from synthesized nucleic acid ligand libraries the high affinity nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) for interesting targets. Recently, the {SELEX} experiments have advanced from targeting the ligand libraries by a single purified target to multiple heterogeneous target samples. Having the potential of bringing enormous technical and economical advantages to drug discovery, the new application suffers from unpredictable performances. To gain an insight of the new method, we develop a computer model to numerically analyze the subtractive {SELEX} alternatively against two distinct heterogeneous samples of unknown targets. The model features the discretization of ligand library, the ligand-target binding equilibrium equations, and the separation efficiency of bound and unbound ligands in experiments. By computer simulations, we investigate how aptamers for desired targets embedded in undefined target mixtures are generated under different experimental conditions. We find the iterative screening scheme is fundamentally capable of developing desired aptamers. On the other hand, target sample configuration and separation efficiency may all together significantly diversify the screening dynamics and results.},

  abstract={In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nrd1-dependent termination and processing pathways play an important role in surveillance and processing of non-coding ribonucleic acids {(RNAs).} The termination and subsequent processing is dependent on the Nrd1 complex consisting of two {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 and Sen1 helicase. It is established that Nrd1 and Nab3 cooperatively recognize specific termination elements within nascent {RNA,} {GUA[A/G]} and {UCUU[G],} respectively. Interestingly, some transcripts do not require {GUA[A/G]} motif for transcription termination in vivo and binding in vitro, suggesting the existence of alternative Nrd1-binding motifs. Here we studied the structure and {RNA-binding} properties of Nrd1 using nuclear magnetic resonance {(NMR),} fluorescence anisotropy and phenotypic analyses in vivo. We determined the solution structure of a two-domain {RNA-binding} fragment of Nrd1, formed by an {RNA-recognition} motif and helix-loop bundle. {NMR} and fluorescence data show that not only {GUA[A/G]} but also several other G-rich and {AU-rich} motifs are able to bind Nrd1 with affinity in a low micromolar range. The broad substrate specificity is achieved by adaptable interaction surfaces of the {RNA-recognition} motif and helix-loop bundle domains that sandwich the {RNA} substrates. Our findings have implication for the role of Nrd1 in termination and processing of many non-coding {RNAs} arising from bidirectional pervasive transcription.},

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} transcribes both coding and noncoding genes, and termination of these different classes of transcripts is facilitated by different sets of termination factors. {Pre-mRNAs} are terminated through a process that is coupled to the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, and noncoding {RNAs} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are terminated through a pathway directed by the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and the {RNA} helicase Sen1. We have used an in vivo cross-linking approach to map the binding sites of components of the yeast {non-poly(A)} termination pathway. We show here that Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 bind to a number of noncoding {RNAs} in an unexpected manner. Sen1 shows a preference for {H/ACA} over box {C/D} {snoRNAs.} Nrd1, which binds to {snoRNA} terminators, also binds to the upstream region of some {snoRNA} transcripts and to {snoRNAs} embedded in introns. We present results showing that several {RNAs,} including the telomerase {RNA} {TLC1,} require Nrd1 for proper processing. Binding of Nrd1 to transcripts from {tRNA} genes is another unexpected observation. We also observe {RNA} polymerase {II} binding to transcripts from {RNA} polymerase {III} genes, indicating a possible role for the Nrd1 pathway in surveillance of transcripts synthesized by the wrong polymerase. The binding targets of Nrd1 pathway components change in the absence of glucose, with Nrd1 and Nab3 showing a preference for binding to sites in the mature {snoRNA} and {tRNAs.} This suggests a novel role for Nrd1 and Nab3 in destruction of {ncRNAs} in response to nutrient limitation.},

This method is rapid (the protocol can be completed in 2 d) and cost-effective, exhibits negligible detection of background noise from unlabeled transcripts, requires no radioactive materials and can be performed from as few as 500,000 nuclei.

Here we report the solution structure of the {RNA-recognition} motif {(RRM)} of Nab3 in complex with a {UCUU} oligonucleotide, representing the Nab3 termination element. The structure shows that the first three nucleotides of {UCUU} are accommodated on the {\&\#x3B2;-sheet} surface of Nab3 {RRM,} but reveals a sequence-specific recognition only for the central cytidine and uridine. The specific contacts we identified are important for binding affinity in vitro as well as for yeast viability. Furthermore, we show that both {RNA-binding} motifs of Nab3 and Nrd1 alone bind their termination elements with a weak affinity. Interestingly, when Nab3 and Nrd1 form a heterodimer, the affinity to {RNA} is significantly increased due to the cooperative binding. These findings are in accordance with the model of their function in the {poly(A)} independent termination, in which binding to the combined and/or repetitive termination elements elicits efficient termination.},

Its expression is controlled by guanine nucleotides through a set of alternate start sites and an intervening transcriptional terminator. In the off state, transcription results in a short non-coding {RNA} that starts upstream of the gene. Transcription terminates via the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} complex and is degraded by the nuclear exosome. Using a sensitive terminator read-through assay, we identified trans-acting Terminator Override {(TOV)} genes that operate this terminator. Four genes were identified: the {RNA} polymerase {II} phosphatase {SSU72,} the {RNA} polymerase {II} binding protein {PCF11,} the {TRAMP} subunit {TRF4} and the {hnRNP-like,} {NAB3.} The {TOV} phenotype can be explained by the loss of function of these gene products as described in models in which termination and {RNA} degradation are coupled to the phosphorylation state of {RNA} polymerase {II's} repeat domain. The most interesting mutations were those found in {NAB3,} which led to the finding that the removal of merely three carboxy-terminal amino acids compromised Nab3's function. This region of previously unknown function is distant from the protein's well-known {RNA} binding and Nrd1 binding domains. Structural homology modeling suggests this Nab3 'tail' forms an {\&\#x3B1;-helical} multimerization domain that helps assemble it onto an {RNA} substrate.},

Our data suggest that the non-template strand bulge is extruded into solvent in complexes containing a 5-mer {RNA,} whereas the template strand bulge remains within the template strand tunnel, exerting stress on interactions between the {\&\#x3B2;} flap, {\&\#x3B2;'} clamp, and {\&\#x3C3;3.2.} We propose that this stress contributes to {\&\#x3C3;3.2} displacement from the {RNA} exit channel, facilitating promoter escape.},

  abstract={Annotation transfer is a principal process in genome annotation. It involves {"}transferring{"} structural and functional annotation to uncharacterized open reading frames {(ORFs)} in a newly completed genome from experimentally characterized proteins similar in sequence. To prevent errors in genome annotation, it is important that this process be robust and statistically well-characterized, especially with regard to how it depends on the degree of sequence similarity. Previously, we and others have analyzed annotation transfer in single-domain proteins. Multi-domain proteins, which make up the bulk of the {ORFs} in eukaryotic genomes, present more complex issues in functional conservation. Here we present a large-scale survey of annotation transfer in these proteins, using scop superfamilies to define domain folds and a thesaurus based on {SWISS-PROT} keywords to define functional categories. Our survey reveals that multi-domain proteins have significantly less functional conservation than single-domain ones, except when they share the exact same combination of domain folds. In particular, we find that for multi-domain proteins, approximate function can be accurately transferred with only 35\% certainty for pairs of proteins sharing one structural superfamily. In contrast, this value is 67\% for pairs of single-domain proteins sharing the same structural superfamily. On the other hand, if two multi-domain proteins contain the same combination of two structural superfamilies the probability of their sharing the same function increases to 80\% in the case of complete coverage along the full length of both proteins, this value increases further to \&gt; 90\%. Moreover, we found that only 70 of the current total of 455 structural superfamilies are found in both single and multi-domain proteins and only 14 of these were associated with the same function in both categories of proteins. We also investigated the degree to which function could be transferred between pairs of multi-domain proteins with respect to the degree of sequence similarity between them, finding that functional divergence at a given amount of sequence similarity is always about two-fold greater for pairs of multi-domain proteins (sharing similarity over a single domain) in comparison to pairs of single-domain ones, though the overall shape of the relationship is quite similar.

  abstract={A new {DNA} aptamer targeting Protein A is presented. The aptamer was selected by use of the {FluMag-SELEX} procedure. The {SELEX} technology {(Systematic} Evolution of Ligands by {EXponential} enrichment) is widely applied as an in vitro selection and amplification method to generate target-specific aptamers and exists in various modified variants. {FluMag-SELEX} is one of them and is characterized by the use of magnetic beads for target immobilization and fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides for monitoring the aptamer selection progress. Structural investigations and sequence truncation experiments of the selected aptamer for Protein A led to the conclusion, that a stem-loop structure at its 5'-end including the 5'-primer binding site is essential for aptamer-target binding. Extensive interaction analyses between aptamer and Protein A were performed by methods like surface plasmon resonance, {MicroScale} Thermophoresis and bead-based binding assays using fluorescence measurements. The binding of the aptamer to its target was thus investigated in assays with immobilization of one of the binding partners each, and with both binding partners in solution. Affinity constants were determined in the low micromolar to submicromolar range, increasing to the nanomolar range under the assumption of avidity. Protein A provides more than one binding site for the aptamer, which may overlap with the known binding sites for immunoglobulins. The aptamer binds specifically to both native and recombinant Protein A, but not to other immunoglobulin-binding proteins like Protein G and L. Cross specificity to other proteins was not found. The application of the aptamer is directed to Protein A detection or affinity purification. Moreover, whole cells of Staphylococcus aureus, presenting Protein A on the cell surface, could also be bound by the aptamer.},

  abstract={Termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} transcription is a fundamental step of gene expression that involves the release of the nascent transcript and dissociation of {RNAPII} from the {DNA} template. As transcription termination is intimately linked to {RNA} 3' end processing, termination pathways have a key decisive influence on the fate of the transcribed {RNA.} Quite remarkably, when reaching the 3' end of genes, a substantial fraction of {RNAPII} fail to terminate transcription, requiring the contribution of alternative or {"}fail-safe{"} mechanisms of termination to release the polymerase. This point of view covers redundant mechanisms of transcription termination and how they relate to conventional termination models. In particular, we expand on recent findings that propose a reverse torpedo model of termination, in which the 3'\&\#x2192;5' exonucleolytic activity of the {RNA} exosome targets transcription events associated with paused and backtracked {RNAPII.}},

  abstract={Transcriptional regulation requires the binding of transcription factors {(TFs)} to short sequence-specific {DNA} motifs, usually located at the gene regulatory regions. Interestingly, based on a vast amount of data accumulated from genomic assays, it has been shown that only a small fraction of all potential binding sites containing the consensus motif of a given {TF} actually bind the protein. Recent in vitro binding assays, which exclude the effects of the cellular environment, also demonstrate selective {TF} binding. An intriguing conjecture is that the surroundings of cognate binding sites have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other sequences containing a similar motif that are not bound by the {TF.} To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and {DNA} shape features surrounding the core-binding sites of 239 and 56 {TFs} extracted from in vitro {HT-SELEX} binding assays and in vivo {ChIP-seq} data, respectively. Comparing the nucleotide content of the regions around the {TF-bound} sites to the counterpart unbound regions containing the same consensus motifs revealed significant differences that extend far beyond the core-binding site. Specifically, the environment of the bound motifs demonstrated unique sequence compositions, {DNA} shape features, and overall high similarity to the core-binding motif. Notably, the regions around the binding sites of {TFs} that belong to the same {TF} families exhibited similar features, with high agreement between the in vitro and in vivo data sets. We propose that these unique features assist in guiding {TFs} to their cognate binding sites.},

Similarly to small nucleolar and small nuclear {RNAs,} transcription of {CUT-encoding} genes is terminated by the Nrd1 complex pathway. We show here that this termination mode and ensuing {CUTs} degradation crucially depend on the position of {RNA} polymerase {II} relative to the transcription start site. Notably, position sensing correlates with the phosphorylation status of the polymerase C-terminal domain {(CTD).} The Nrd1 complex is recruited to chromatin via interactions with both the nascent {RNA} and the {CTD,} but a permissive phosphorylation status of the latter is absolutely required for efficient transcription termination. We discuss the mechanism underlying the regulation of coexisting cryptic and {mRNA-productive} transcription.},

  abstract={Due to their high affinity and specificity, aptamers have been widely used as effective inhibitors in clinical applications. However, the ability to activate protein function through aptamer-protein interaction has not been well-elucidated. To investigate their potential as target-specific agonists, we used {SELEX} to generate aptamers to the insulin receptor {(IR)} and identified an agonistic aptamer named {IR-A48} that specifically binds to {IR,} but not to {IGF-1} receptor. Despite its capacity to stimulate {IR} autophosphorylation, similar to insulin, we found that {IR-A48} not only binds to an allosteric site distinct from the insulin binding site, but also preferentially induces Y1150 phosphorylation in the {IR} kinase domain. Moreover, Y1150-biased phosphorylation induced by {IR-A48} selectively activates specific signaling pathways downstream of {IR.} In contrast to insulin-mediated activation of {IR,} {IR-A48} binding has little effect on the {MAPK} pathway and proliferation of cancer cells. Instead, {AKT} S473 phosphorylation is highly stimulated by {IR-A48,} resulting in increased glucose uptake both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present {IR-A48} as a biased agonist able to selectively induce the metabolic activity of {IR} through allosteric binding. Furthermore, our study also suggests that aptamers can be a promising tool for developing artificial biased agonists to targeted receptors.},

  year={2015},
  abstract={The hepatitis B virus {(HBV)} particle is an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope containing viral surface proteins. A small domain (matrix domain, {MD)} in the large surface protein L and a narrow region (matrix binding domain, {MBD)} including isoleucine 126 on the capsid surface have been mapped where point mutations like {core-I126A} specifically blocked nucleocapsid envelopment. Possibly, both domains interact with each other during virion morphogenesis. By the {SELEX} method we evolved {DNA} aptamers from an oligonucleotide library binding to purified recombinant capsids but not binding to the corresponding {I126A} mutant capsids. Aptamers bound to capsids were separated from unbound molecules by filtration. After 13 rounds of selections and amplifications 16 different aptamers were found among 73 clones. The four most frequent aptamers represented more than 50 \% of the clones. The main aptamer {AO-01} (13 clones, 18 \%) showed the lowest dissociation constant {(Kd)} of 180 +/- 82 {nM} for capsid binding among the four molecules. Its Kd value for {I126A} capsids was 1306 +/- 503 {nM.} Cotransfection of Huh7 cells with {AO-01} and an {HBV} genomic construct resulted in 47 \% inhibition of virion production 3 days post transfection but showed no inhibition by cotransfection of an aptamer with random sequence. The half-life of {AO-01} in cells was 2 hours which might explain the incomplete inhibition. The results support the importance of the {MBD} for nucleocapsid envelopment. Inhibiting the {MD-MBD} interaction by a low molecular weight substance might represent a new approach for an antiviral therapy.},

Here, we report a new selection scheme, {RAPID-SELEX} {(RNA} Aptamer Isolation via Dual-cycles {SELEX),} that simplifies this process by systematically skipping unnecessary amplification steps.

High-throughput sequencing of the enriched pools from both {RAPID} and {SELEX} revealed many identical candidate aptamers from the starting pool of 5 {\&\#xD7;} 10(15) sequences. For {CHK2,} the same sequence was preferentially enriched in both selections as the top candidate and was found to bind to its respective target.

The improvements of this strategy included: (1) using a {FAM-labeled} probe to track {protein-DNA} complex in polyacrylamide gel for rapidly recovering the protein-bound {dsDNA} without relying on traditional radioactive labeling or ethidium bromide staining; (2) monitoring the specificity of {SELEX} selection by detecting a positive and negative sequence doped into the input {DNAs} used in each round with {PCR} amplification; (3) using nested {PCR} to ensure the specificity of {PCR} amplification of the selected {DNAs} after each round; (4) using the nucleotides added at the 5' end of the nested {PCR} primers as the split barcode to code {DNAs} from various rounds for multiplexing sequencing samples. The split barcode minimized selection times and thus greatly simplified the current {SELEX-Seq} procedure. The reliability of the strategy was demonstrated by performing a successful {SELEX-Seq} of a well-known transcription factor, {NF-\&\#x3BA;B.} Therefore, this study provided a useful {SELEX-Seq} strategy for characterizing {DNA-binding} specificities of transcription factors.},

Although there are many {NGS} applications, one of the most commonly used techniques {'RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq)'} is rapidly replacing microarray-based techniques in laboratories around the world. As more and more of such techniques are standardized, allowing technicians to perform these experiments with minimal hands-on time and reduced experimental/operator-dependent biases, the bottleneck of such techniques is clearly visible; that is, data analysis. Further complicating the matter, increasing evidence suggests most of the genome is transcribed into {RNA;} however, the majority of these {RNAs} are not translated into proteins. These {RNAs} that do not become proteins are called 'noncoding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)'.} Although some time has passed since the discovery of {ncRNAs,} their annotations remain poor, making analysis of {RNA-seq} data challenging. Here, we examine the current limitations of {RNA-seq} analysis using case studies focused on the detection of novel transcripts and examination of their characteristics. Finally, we validate the presence of novel transcripts using biological experiments, showing novel transcripts can be accurately identified when a series of filters is applied. In conclusion, novel transcripts that are identified from {RNA-seq} must be examined carefully before proceeding to biological experiments.},

  abstract={Mechanisms conferring robustness against regulatory variants have been controversial. Previous studies suggested widespread buffering of {RNA} misexpression on protein levels during translation. We do not find evidence that translational buffering is common. Instead, we find extensive buffering at the level of {RNA} expression, exerted through negative feedback regulation acting in trans, which reduces the effect of regulatory variants on gene expression. Our approach is based on a novel experimental design in which allelic differential expression in a yeast hybrid strain is compared to allelic differential expression in a pool of its spores. Allelic differential expression in the hybrid is due to cis-regulatory differences only. Instead, in the pool of spores allelic differential expression is not only due to cis-regulatory differences but also due to local trans effects that include negative feedback. We found that buffering through such local trans regulation is widespread, typically compensating for about 15\% of cis-regulatory effects on individual genes. Negative feedback is stronger not only for essential genes, indicating its functional relevance, but also for genes with low to middle levels of expression, for which tight regulation matters most. We suggest that negative feedback is one mechanism of Waddington's canalization, facilitating the accumulation of genetic variants that might give selective advantage in different environments.},

Compared with conventional profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation, the analysis of the {BioGRO} profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that {RNA} polymerase {II} has unique activity profiles at both gene ends, which are highly dependent on positioned nucleosomes. This is the first demonstration of the in vivo influence of positioned nucleosomes on transcription elongation. The particular features at the 5' end and around the polyadenylation site indicate that this polymerase undergoes extensive specific-activity regulation in the initial and final transcription elongation phases. The genes encoding for ribosomal proteins show distinctive features at both ends. {BioGRO} also provides the first nascentome analysis for {RNA} polymerase {III,} which indicates that transcription of {tRNA} genes is poorly regulated at the individual copy level.

Even in model organisms, precisely determining causative genes and their interactions has remained elusive, due in part to difficulty in narrowing intervals to single genes and in detecting epistasis or linked quantitative trait loci. These difficulties are exacerbated by limitations in experimental design, such as low numbers of analyzed individuals or of polymorphisms between parental genomes. We address these challenges by applying three independent high-throughput approaches for {QTL} mapping to map the genetic variants underlying 11 phenotypes in two genetically distant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, namely (1) individual analysis of \&gt;700 meiotic segregants, (2) bulk segregant analysis, and (3) reciprocal hemizygosity scanning, a new genome-wide method that we developed. We reveal differences in the performance of each approach and, by combining them, identify eight polymorphic genes that affect eight different phenotypes: colony shape, flocculation, growth on two nonfermentable carbon sources, and resistance to two drugs, salt, and high temperature. Our results demonstrate the power of individual segregant analysis to dissect {QTL} and address the underestimated contribution of interactions between variants. We also reveal confounding factors like mutations and aneuploidy in pooled approaches, providing valuable lessons for future designs of complex trait mapping studies.},

Nrd1 mediates a severe reduction in {pre-mRNA} production from a reporter gene bearing an exogenous sequence element in its intron. The effect of the inserted element is highly sequence-specific and is accompanied by the appearance of 3'-truncated transcripts. We have proposed that Nrd1 binds to the exogenous sequence element in the nascent {pre-mRNA} during transcription, aided by the {CTD-binding} motif, and directs 3'-end formation a short distance downstream. Here we show that highly purified Nrd1 carboxyl half binds tightly to the {RNA} element in vitro with sequence specificity that correlates with the efficiency of cis-element-directed down-regulation in vivo. A large deletion in the {CTD-binding} motif blocks down-regulation but does not affect the essential function of Nrd1. Furthermore, a nonsense mutant allele that produces truncated Nrd1 protein lacking the {RRM} has a dominant-negative effect on down-regulation but not on cell growth. Viability of this and several other nonsense alleles of Nrd1 appears to require translational readthrough, which in one case is extremely efficient. Thus the {CTD-binding} motif of Nrd1 is important for {pre-mRNA} down-regulation but is not required for the essential function of Nrd1. In contrast, the {RNA-binding} activity of Nrd1 appears to be required both for down-regulation and for its essential function.}

Although {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} have been used to predict {TF} binding sites, a predictive model that jointly considers {CS} and {DS} has not been developed to predict either {TF-specific} binding or general binding properties of {TFs.} Using budding yeast as model, we found that machine learning classifiers trained with either {CS} or {DS} features alone perform better in predicting {TF-specific} binding compared to {SM-based} classifiers. In addition, simultaneously considering {CS} and {DS} further improves the accuracy of the {TF} binding predictions, indicating the highly complementary nature of these two properties. The contributions of {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} features to binding site predictions differ greatly between {TFs,} allowing {TF-specific} predictions and potentially reflecting different {TF} binding mechanisms. In addition, a {{"}TF-agnostic{"}} predictive model based on three {DNA} {"}intrinsic properties{"} (in silico predicted nucleosome occupancy, major groove geometry, and dinucleotide free energy) that can be calculated from genomic sequences alone has performance that rivals the model incorporating experiment-derived data. This intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions not only across {TFs,} but also across {DNA-binding} domain families with distinct structural folds. Furthermore, these predicted binding regions can help identify {TF} binding sites that have a significant impact on target gene expression. Because the intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions across {DNA-binding} domain families, it is {TF} agnostic and likely describes general binding potential of {TFs.} Thus, our findings suggest that it is feasible to establish a {TF} agnostic model for identifying functional regulatory regions in potentially any sequenced genome.},

  author={Dewar, James M and Budzowska, Magda and Walter, Johannes C},
  journal={Nature},
  year={2015},
  abstract={Eukaryotic {DNA} replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge. Termination involves local completion of {DNA} synthesis, decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. Termination has been difficult to study because termination events are generally asynchronous and sequence nonspecific. To overcome these challenges, we paused converging replisomes with a site-specific barrier in Xenopus egg extracts. Upon removal of the barrier, forks underwent synchronous and site-specific termination, allowing mechanistic dissection of this process. We show that {DNA} synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative {CMG} helicase (comprising {CDC45,} {MCM2-7} and {GINS)} occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of {DNA} synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging {CMGs} pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded {DNA.} This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of {DNA} synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.},

  abstract={Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small {RNA-sequencing} experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental {RNA-sequencing} data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package.},

  abstract={A wide variety of large-scale data have been produced in bioinformatics. In response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses because of factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new generations of storage devices have emerged, such as {NAND} flash-based solid-state drives {(SSDs),} and with the renewed interest in near-data processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement of hard disk drives by {SSDs} results in dramatic speedup. Despite the various advantages and continuous cost reduction of {SSDs,} there has been little review of {SSD-based} profiling and performance exploration of important but time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research, we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit {SSDs.} The programs we profile cover traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly, mapping, expression analysis, variant calling and metagenomics. We explain how acceleration by parallelization can be combined with {SSDs} for improved performance and also how using {SSDs} can expedite important bioinformatics pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and transcriptome analysis using {RNA} sequencing. We hope that this review can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful storage devices.},

We show that the regulatory properties of the two promoter types are remarkably similar, suggesting that they are determined to a large extent by Rap1 and the {Fhl1/Ifh1} pair. Rapid depletion experiments allowed us to define a hierarchy of {TF} binding in which Rap1 acts as a pioneer factor required for binding of all other {TFs.} We also uncovered unexpected features underlying recruitment of Fhl1, whose forkhead {DNA-binding} domain is not required for binding at most promoters, and Hmo1, whose binding is supported by repeated motifs. Finally, we describe unusually micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)-sensitive} nucleosomes at all {RPG} promoters, located between the canonical +1 and -1 nucleosomes, which coincide with sites of {Fhl1/Ifh1} and Hmo1 binding. We speculate that these {"}fragile{"} nucleosomes play an important role in regulating {RPG} transcriptional output.},

  abstract={{{"}One,} no one and one hundred thousand{"} is a masterpiece of Italian literature, written by Luigi Pirandello. The central theme is that in each individual there are multiple personalities, since one's perception of one's self differs from the view of others. As a consequence, a unique identity does not exist, but rather one hundred thousand. This concept can be very well applied to the kinetochore, one of the largest macromolecular complexes conserved in eukaryotes. The kinetochore is essential during cell division and fulfills different sophisticated functions, including linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules and delaying anaphase onset in case of incorrect bi-orientation. In order to perform these tasks, the kinetochore shapes its structure by recruiting different subunits, such as the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint {(SAC)} or the monopolin complex during meiosis. It also modifies its internal organization by rearranging intramolecular connections and acquiring a distinct identity at different time points of cell division. In this review, we describe recent insights into the changes in composition and configuration of the kinetochore in mitosis and meiosis, focusing on the kinetochore of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

  abstract={The centromere is the genetic locus that organizes the proteinaceous kinetochore and is responsible for attachment of the chromosome to the spindle at mitosis and meiosis. In most eukaryotes, the centromere consists of highly repetitive {DNA} sequences that are occupied by nucleosomes containing the {CenH3} histone variant, whereas in budding yeast, a {\&\#x223C;120-bp} centromere {DNA} element {(CDE)} that is sufficient for centromere function is occupied by a single right-handed histone variant {CenH3} {(Cse4)} nucleosome. However, these in vivo observations are inconsistent with in vitro evidence for left-handed octameric {CenH3} nucleosomes. To help resolve these inconsistencies, we characterized yeast centromeric chromatin at single base-pair resolution. Intact particles containing both Cse4 and {H2A} are precisely protected from micrococcal nuclease over the entire {CDE} of all 16 yeast centromeres in both solubilized chromatin and the insoluble kinetochore. Small {DNA-binding} proteins protect {CDEI} and {CDEIII} and delimit the centromeric nucleosome to the {\&\#x223C;80-bp} {CDEII,} only enough for a single {DNA} wrap. As expected for a tripartite organization of centromeric chromatin, loss of Cbf1 protein, which binds to {CDEI,} both reduces the size of the centromere-protected region and shifts its location toward {CDEIII.} Surprisingly, Cse4 overproduction caused genome-wide misincorporation of nonfunctional {CenH3-containing} nucleosomes that protect {\&\#x223C;135} base pairs and are preferentially enriched at sites of high nucleosome turnover. Our detection of two forms of {CenH3} nucleosomes in the yeast genome, a singly wrapped particle at the functional centromere and octamer-sized particles on chromosome arms, reconcile seemingly conflicting in vivo and in vitro observations.},

The {TFIIIB-dependent} 5'-flanking {DNA} protein interaction was predominantly not sequence specific. The extension of the transcription complex into this {DNA} segment does suggest two possible explanations for highly diverse effects of flanking-sequence substitutions on {tRNA} gene transcription: either (i) proteins that are capable of binding to these upstream {DNA} segments are also potentially capable of stimulating or interfering with the incorporation of {TFIIIB} into transcription complexes or (ii) 5'-flanking sequence influences the rate of assembly of {TFIIIB} into stable transcription complexes.}

We show that the minimal length of the Cpf1 binding site needed for full in vitro binding and in vivo activity is 10 base pairs long comprised of {CDEI} plus the two base pairs 3' of this sequence. The palindromic core sequence {CACGTG} is most important for in vivo {CEN} function and in vitro Cpf1 binding. Symmetrical mutations in either halfsite of the core sequence affect in vitro Cpf1 binding and in vivo mitotic centromere function asymmetrically albeit to a different extent. Enlarging the {CDEI} palindrome to 12 or 20 bps increases in vitro Cpf1 binding but results in increased chromosome loss rates suggesting a need for asymmetrical Cpf1 binding sequences. Additionally, the ability of Cpf1 protein to bind a mutant {CDEI} element in vitro does not parallel the ability of that mutant to confer in vivo {CEN} activity. Our data indicate that the in vitro binding characteristics of Cpf1 to {CDEI} only partly overlap with their corresponding activity within the centromere complex, thus suggesting that in the in vivo situation the {CDEI/Cpf1} complex might undergo interactions with other centromere {DNA/protein} complexes.}

In contrast, the extent of pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 phosphorylation did not closely correlate with {poly(A)} site selection. We conclude that changes in properties of the transcription elongation complex closely correlate with utilization of different {poly(A)} sites, suggesting that co-transcriptional events may influence the decision between alternative modes of {pre-mRNA} 3' end processing.},

The {RSC} nucleosome remodeler acts through the motifs to establish {stable\&\#xA0;+1} and -1 nucleosome positions, while binding of a small set of general regulatory (pioneer) factors at fragile nucleosome promoters plays a key role in their destabilization.

In cells expressing {DIS3} with both catalytic sites mutated, {RNAs} originating from unannotated genomic regions increased {\&\#x223C;2.5-fold,} covering {\&\#x223C;70\%} of the genome and allowing for thousands of novel transcripts to be discovered. Previously described pervasive transcription products, such as Promoter Upstream Transcripts {(PROMPTs),} accumulated robustly upon {DIS3} dysfunction, representing a significant fraction of {PAR-CLIP} reads. We have also detected relatively long putative premature {RNA} polymerase {II} termination products of protein-coding genes whose levels in {DIS3} mutant cells can exceed the mature {mRNAs,} indicating that production of such truncated {RNA} is a common phenomenon. In addition, we found {DIS3} to be involved in controlling the formation of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that are organized around {NEAT1} {lncRNA,} whose short form was overexpressed in cells with mutated {DIS3.} Moreover, the {DIS3} mutations resulted in misregulation of expression of {\&\#x223C;50\%} of transcribed protein-coding genes, probably as a secondary effect of accumulation of various noncoding {RNA} species. Finally, cells expressing mutant {DIS3} accumulated {snoRNA} precursors, which correlated with a strong {PAR-CLIP} signal, indicating that {DIS3} is the main {snoRNA-processing} enzyme. {EXOSC10} {(RRP6)} instead controls the levels of the mature {snoRNAs.} Overall, we show that {DIS3} has a major nucleoplasmic function in shaping the human {RNA} polymerase {II} transcriptome.},

Here, we present a method to identify {poly(A)} sites in a genome-wide and strand-specific manner. This method, termed {3'T-fill,} initially fills in the {poly(A)} stretch with unlabeled {dTTPs,} allowing sequencing to start directly after the {poly(A)} tail into the 3'-untranslated regions {(UTR).} Our comparative analysis demonstrates that it outperforms existing protocols in quality and throughput and accurately quantifies {RNA} levels as only one read is produced from each transcript. We use this method to characterize the diversity of polyadenylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showing that alternative {RNA} molecules are present even in a genetically identical cell population. Finally, we observe that overlap of convergent {3'-UTRs} is frequent but sharply limited by coding regions, suggesting factors that restrict compression of the yeast genome.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic transcription is pervasive, and many of {the\&\#xA0;resulting} {RNAs} are non-coding. It is unknown whether ubiquitous transcription is functional or simply reflects stochastic transcriptional noise. By single-molecule visualization of the dynamic interplay between coding and non-coding transcription at the {GAL} locus in living yeast cells, we show that antisense {GAL10} {ncRNA} transcription can switch between functional and spurious under different conditions. During galactose induction, {GAL10} sense transcription occurs in short stochastic bursts, which are unaffected by transcription of antisense {GAL10} {ncRNA,} even when both are present simultaneously at the same locus. In contrast, when {GAL10} is not induced, {ncRNA} transcription is critical to prevent transcriptional leakage of {GAL1} and {GAL10.} Suppression of {ncRNA} transcription by strand-specific {CRISPR/dCas9} results in transcriptional leakage of the inducer {GAL1,} leading to a more sensitive transcription activation threshold, an alteration of metabolic switching, and a fitness defect in competition experiments.},

Gon7 interacts with the same Pcc1 region engaged in the archaeal Pcc1 homodimer.

By determining the cellular fate of the generated transcripts, transcription termination pathways shape the transcriptome. Recent reports have underscored the crucial role of these pathways in limiting the extent of pervasive transcription, which has attracted interest in post-initiation events in gene expression control. Transcription termination pathways involved in the production of non-coding {RNAs} - such as the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} pathway in yeast and the cap-binding complex {(CBC)-ARS2} pathway in humans - are key determinants of transcription quality control. Understanding the mechanisms leading to the timely and efficient dismantling of elongation complexes remains a major unmet challenge, but new insights into the molecular basis of termination at {mRNA-coding} and non-coding {RNA} gene targets have been gained in eukaryotes.},

  journal={Nature},

  abstract={One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors {(TFs)} and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several {TFs,} indicating that {TFs} function synergistically and combinatorially. However, while {TF} binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of {TFs} and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which {TFs} participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different {TFs} form functionally distinct groups, or if certain {TFs} might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of {TFs} and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited {GAL4-DNA-binding-domain} fusions of 812 Drosophila {TFs} and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of {TFs} that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar {TFs} can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging {TF} motifs, and {TF-cofactor} pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of {TFs} and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.},

We find that pre-initiation complex formation is an essentially undirected process, giving rise to a large number of bidirectional promoters and to pervasive antisense transcription. Notably, 12\% of all transcriptionally active positions showed simultaneous activity on both strands.

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotic cells initiates from multiple replication origins that are distributed throughout the genome. Coordinating the usage of these origins is crucial to ensure complete and timely replication of the entire genome precisely once in each cell cycle. Replication origins fire according to a cell-type-specific temporal programme, which is established in the G1 phase of each cell cycle. In response to conditions causing the slowing or stalling of {DNA} replication forks, the programme of origin firing is altered in two contrasting ways, depending on chromosomal context. First, inactive or 'dormant' replication origins in the vicinity of the stalled replication fork become activated and, second, the S phase checkpoint induces a global shutdown of further origin firing throughout the genome. Here, we review our current understanding on the role of dormant origins and the S phase checkpoint in the rescue of stalled forks and the completion of {DNA} replication in the presence of replicative stress.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication is tightly controlled in eukaryotic cells to ensure that an exact copy of the genetic material is inherited by both daughter cells. Oscillating waves of cyclin-dependent kinase {(CDK)} and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome {(APC/C)} activities provide a binary switch that permits the replication of each chromosome exactly once per cell cycle. Work from several organisms has revealed a conserved strategy whereby inactive replication complexes are assembled onto {DNA} during periods of low {CDK} and high {APC} activity but are competent to execute genome duplication only when these activities are reversed. Periods of high {CDK} and low {APC/C} serve an essential function by blocking reassembly of replication complexes, thereby preventing rereplication. Higher eukaryotes have evolved additional {CDK-independent} mechanisms for preventing rereplication.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic genomes are replicated from large numbers of replication origins distributed on multiple chromosomes. The activity of these origins must be coordinated so that the entire genome is efficiently and accurately replicated yet no region of the genome is ever replicated more than once. The past decade has seen significant advances in understanding how the initiation of {DNA} replication is regulated by key cell-cycle regulators, including the cyclin dependent kinases {(CDKs)} and the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome {(APC/C).} The assembly of essential prereplicative complexes {(pre-RCs)} at origins only occurs when {CDK} activity is low and {APC/C} activity is high. Origin firing, however, can only occur when the {APC/C} is inactivated and {CDKs} become active. This two step mechanism ensures that no origin can fire more than once in a cell cycle. In all eukaryotes tested, {CDKs} can contribute to the inhibition of {pre-RC} assembly. This inhibition is characterised both by high degrees of redundancy and evolutionary plasticity. Geminin plays a crucial role in inhibiting licensing in metazoans and, like cyclins, is inactivated by the {APC/C.} Strategies involved in preventing re-replication in different organisms will be discussed.},

  abstract={The replication of genomic {DNA} is limited to a single round per cell cycle. The first component, which recognises and remains bound to origins from recognition until activation and replication elongation, is the origin recognition complex. How origin recognition complex {(ORC)} proteins remain associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle is not yet completely understood. Several genome-wide studies have undoubtedly demonstrated that {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP-II)} binding sites overlap with replication origins and with the binding sites of the replication components. {RNAP-II} is no longer merely associated with transcription elongation. Several reports have demonstrated that {RNAP-II} molecules affect chromatin structure, transcription, {mRNA} processing, recombination and {DNA} repair, among others. Most of these activities have been reported to directly depend on the interaction of proteins with the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNAP-II.} Two-dimensional gels results and {ChIP} analysis presented herein suggest that stalled {RNAP-II} molecules bound to the {rDNA} chromatin participate in the anchoring of {ORC} proteins to origins during the G1 and S-phases. The results show that in the absence of {RNAP-II,} Orc1p, Orc2p and Cdc6p do not bind to origins. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that {Ser2P-CTD} and hypophosphorylated {RNAP-II} interact with Orc1p. In the context of {rDNA,} cryptic transcription by {RNAP-II} did not negatively interfere with {DNA} replication. However, the results indicate that {RNAP-II} is not necessary to maintain the binding of {ORCs} to the origins during metaphase. These findings highlight for the first time the potential importance of stalled {RNAP-II} in the regulation of {DNA} replication.},

  abstract={To get insights into the regulation of replication initiation, we systematically mapped replication origins along 1\% of the human genome in {HeLa} cells. We identified 283 origins, 10 times more than previously known. Origin density is strongly correlated with genomic landscapes, with clusters of closely spaced origins in {GC-rich} regions and no origins in large {GC-poor} regions. Origin sequences are evolutionarily conserved, and half of them map within or near {CpG} islands. Most of the origins overlap transcriptional regulatory elements, providing further evidence of a connection with gene regulation. Moreover, we identify {c-JUN} and {c-FOS} as important regulators of origin selection. Half of the identified replication initiation sites do not have an open chromatin configuration, showing the absence of a direct link with gene regulation. Replication timing analyses coupled with our origin mapping suggest that a relatively strict origin-timing program regulates the replication of the human genome.},

These {PICs} and their transcription start sites were positionally constrained at {TFIID-engaged} downstream +1 nucleosomes. At {TATA-box-containing} promoters, which are depleted of {TFIID,} a +1 nucleosome was positioned to be in competition with the {PIC,} which may allow greater latitude in start-site selection. Our genomic localization of messenger {RNA} and non-coding {RNA} {PICs} reveals that two {PICs,} in inverted orientation, may occupy the flanking borders of nucleosome-free regions.

Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Our studies represent the first high-resolution analysis--to our knowledge--of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments in vivo, and reveal the interconnection between lagging-strand synthesis and chromatin assembly.},

  abstract={The mini-chromosome maintenance proteins Mcm2-7 are essential for {DNA} replication. They are loaded onto replication origins during G1 phase of the cell cycle to form a pre-replication complex {(pre-RC)} that licenses each origin for subsequent initiation. We have investigated the {DNA} elements that determine the dependence of yeast replication origins on Mcm2-7 activity, i.e. the sensitivity of an origin to mcm mutations. Using chimaeric constructs from mcm sensitive and mcm insensitive origins, we have identified two main elements affecting the requirement for Mcm2-7 function. First, transcription into an origin increases its dependence on Mcm2-7 function, revealing a conflict between {pre-RC} assembly and transcription. Second, sequence elements within the minimal origin influence its mcm sensitivity. Replication origins show similar differences in sensitivity to mutations in other {pre-RC} proteins (such as Origin Recognition Complex and Cdc6), but not to mutations in initiation and elongation factors, demonstrating that the mcm sensitivity of an origin is determined by its ability to establish a {pre-RC.} We propose that there is a hierarchy of replication origins with respect to the range of {pre-RC} protein concentrations under which they will function. This hierarchy is both 'hard-wired' by the minimal origin sequences and 'soft-wired' by local transcriptional context.},

In this review, we discuss recent advances shedding new light on how this complex process is regulated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The picture that emerges from these studies is that replication timing is regulated in cis by mechanisms modulating the chromatin structure and the subnuclear organization of origins. These mechanisms do not affect the licensing of replication origins but determine their ability to compete for limiting initiation factors, which are recycled from early to late origins throughout the length of the S phase.},

  abstract={A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

Rif1 is required for normal genome-wide regulation of replication timing, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells, Rif1 coats late-replicating domains and, with Lamin B1, identifies most of the late-replicating genome. Rif1 is an essential determinant of replication timing of {non-Lamin} B1-bound late domains. We further demonstrate that Rif1 defines and restricts the interactions between replication-timing domains during the G1 phase, thereby revealing a function of Rif1 as organizer of nuclear architecture. Rif1 loss affects both number and replication-timing specificity of the interactions between replication-timing domains. In addition, during the S phase, Rif1 ensures that replication of interacting domains is temporally coordinated. In summary, our study identifies Rif1 as the molecular link between nuclear architecture and replication-timing establishment in mammals.},

The helicase loaders {ORC-Cdc6} function to recruit a single {Cdt1-Mcm2-7} heptamer to replication origins prior to Cdt1 release and {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex formation, but how the second Mcm2-7 hexamer is recruited to promote double-hexamer formation is not well understood. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex and an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7} complex are reported, which together provide new insights into {DNA} licensing. Detailed structural analysis of the loaded Mcm2-7 double-hexamer complex demonstrates that the two hexamers are interlocked and misaligned along the {DNA} axis and lack {ATP} hydrolysis activity that is essential for {DNA} helicase activity. Moreover, we show that the head-to-head juxtaposition of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer generates a new protein interaction surface that creates a multisubunit-binding site for an S-phase protein kinase that is known to activate {DNA} replication. The data suggest how the double hexamer is assembled and how helicase activity is regulated during {DNA} licensing, with implications for cell cycle control of {DNA} replication and genome stability.},

We report that 3' single-stranded (3'-ss) extension mediates {XUTs} degradation by {NMD,} assisted by the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases. Single-gene investigation, genome-wide {RNA} analyses, and double-stranded {(ds)RNA} mapping revealed that 3'-ss extensions discriminate the {NMD-targeted} {XUTs} from stable {lncRNAs.} Ribosome profiling showed that {XUT} are translated, locking them for {NMD} activity. Interestingly, mutants of the Mtr4 and Dbp2 helicases accumulated {XUTs,} suggesting that {dsRNA} unwinding is {a\&\#xA0;critical} step for degradation. Indeed, expression of anticomplementary transcripts protects cryptic intergenic {lncRNAs} from {NMD.} Our results indicate that {aslncRNAs} form {dsRNA} that are only {translated\&\#xA0;and} targeted to {NMD} if dissociated by Mtr4 and Dbp2.

  abstract={{CCR4-NOT} is a large protein complex present both in cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Although it is involved in a variety of distinct processes related to expression of genetic information such as {poly(A)} tail shortening, transcription regulation, nuclear export and protein degradation, there is only fragmentary information available on some of its nine subunits. Here we show a comprehensive structural characterization of the native {CCR4-NOT} complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our {cryo-EM} {3D} reconstruction of the complex, combined with techniques such as immunomicroscopy, {RNA-nanogold} labelling, docking of the available high-resolution structures and models of different subunits and domains, allow us to propose its full molecular architecture. We locate all functionally defined domains endowed with deadenylating and ubiquitinating activities, the nucleus-specific {RNA-interacting} subunit Mmi1, as well as surfaces responsible for protein-protein interactions. This information provides insight into cooperation of the different {CCR4-NOT} complex functions.},

Replication initiates stochastically, primarily within non-transcribed, broad (up to 150\&\#x2009;kb) zones that often abut transcribed genes, and terminates dispersively between them. Replication fork progression is significantly co-oriented with the transcription. Initiation and termination zones are frequently contiguous, sometimes separated by regions of unidirectional replication. Initiation zones are enriched in open chromatin and enhancer marks, even when not flanked by genes, and often border 'topologically associating domains' {(TADs).} Initiation zones are enriched in origin recognition complex {(ORC)-binding} sites and better align to origins previously mapped using bubble-trap than {\&\#x3BB;-exonuclease.} This novel panorama of replication reveals how chromatin and transcription modulate the initiation process to create cell-type-specific replication programs.},

Replication timing is determined by the timing of replication origin firing, which involves activation of {MCM} helicase complexes loaded at replication origins. Nonetheless, how the timing of such origin firing is regulated remains mysterious. Here, we show that the number of {MCMs} loaded at origins regulates replication timing. We show for the first time in vivo that multiple {MCMs} are loaded at origins. Because early origins have more {MCMs} loaded, they are, on average, more likely to fire early in S phase. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed heterogeneity in origin firing and help to explain how defined replication timing profiles emerge from stochastic origin firing. These results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.},

Here, we present the crystal structure of the Mmi1 {YTH} domain in the apo state and in complex with a {DSR} motif, demonstrating that the Mmi1 {YTH} domain selectively recognizes the {DSR} motif. Intriguingly, Mmi1 also contains a potential {m(6)A} {(N(6)-methyladenine)-binding} pocket, but its binding of the {DSR} motif is dependent on a long groove opposite the {m(6)A} pocket.

Furthermore, the {m(6)A} pocket cannot bind {m(6)A} {RNA.} Our structural and biochemical experiments uncover the mechanism of the {YTH} domain in binding the {DSR} motif and help to elucidate the function of Mmi1.},

The transcription rate, which is assumed to be exercised mainly at the {RNA} polymerase recruitment level, can be calculated using the {RNA} polymerase densities determined either by run-on or immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the ideal model organism to generate a complete set of nascent transcription rates that will prove useful for many gene regulation studies. By combining genomic data from both the {GRO} {(Genomic} Run-on) and the {RNA} pol {ChIP-on-chip} methods we generated a new, more accurate nascent transcription rate dataset. By comparing this dataset with the indirect ones obtained from the {mRNA} stabilities and {mRNA} amount datasets, we are able to obtain biological information about posttranscriptional regulation processes and a genomic snapshot of the location of the active transcriptional machinery. We have obtained nascent transcription rates for 4,670 yeast genes. The median {RNA} polymerase {II} density in the genes is 0.078 molecules/kb, which corresponds to an average of 0.096 molecules/gene. Most genes have transcription rates of between 2 and 30 {mRNAs/hour} and less than 1\% of yeast genes have \&gt;1 {RNA} polymerase molecule/gene.

In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin-associated gene silencing is known to be mediated by {RNA} processing pathways including {RNA} interference {(RNAi)} and a 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex, the exosome. Here, we report a new {RNA-processing} pathway that contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin mediated by 5'-3' exoribonuclease {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2.} Dhp1 mutation causes defective gene silencing both at peri-centromeric regions and at the silent mating type locus. Intriguingly, mutation in either of the two well-characterized Dhp1-interacting proteins, the Din1 pyrophosphohydrolase or the Rhn1 transcription termination factor, does not result in silencing defects at the main heterochromatic regions. We demonstrate that Dhp1 interacts with heterochromatic factors and is essential in the sequential steps of establishing silencing in a manner independent of both {RNAi} and the exosome. Genomic and genetic analyses suggest that Dhp1 is involved in post-transcriptional silencing of repetitive regions through its {RNA} processing activity. The results describe the unexpected role of {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2} in chromatin-based silencing and elucidate how various {RNA-processing} pathways, acting together or independently, contribute to epigenetic regulation of the eukaryotic genome.},

  abstract={There is an increasing interest in complementing {RNA-seq} experiments with {small-RNA} {(sRNA)} expression data to obtain a comprehensive view of a transcriptome. Currently, two main experimental challenges concerning {sRNA-seq} exist: how to check the size distribution of isolated {sRNAs,} given the sensitive size-selection steps in the protocol; and how to normalize data between samples, given the low complexity of {sRNA} types. We here present two separate sets of synthetic {RNA} spike-ins for monitoring size-selection and for performing data normalization in {sRNA-seq.} The size-range quality control {(SRQC)} spike-in set, consisting of 11 oligoribonucleotides (10-70 nucleotides), was tested by intentionally altering the size-selection protocol and verified via several comparative experiments. We demonstrate that the {SRQC} set is useful to reproducibly track down biases in the size-selection in {sRNA-seq.} The external reference for data-normalization {(ERDN)} spike-in set, consisting of 19 oligoribonucleotides, was developed for sample-to-sample normalization in differential-expression analysis of {sRNA-seq} data. Testing and applying the {ERDN} set showed that it can reproducibly detect differential expression over a dynamic range of 2(18). Hence, biological variation in {sRNA} composition and content between samples is preserved while technical variation is effectively minimized. Together, both spike-in sets can significantly improve the technical reproducibility of {sRNA-seq.}},

  title={Normalization, testing, and false discovery rate estimation for {RNA-sequencing} data.},

  abstract={We discuss the identification of genes that are associated with an outcome in {RNA} sequencing and other sequence-based comparative genomic experiments. {RNA-sequencing} data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate {(FDR).} Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and {FDR} estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.},

  abstract={Systems biology, with its associated technologies of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, is driving the evolution of our understanding of cardiovascular physiology. Rather than studying individual molecules or even single reactions, a systems approach allows integration of orthogonal data sets from distinct tiers of biological data, including gene, {RNA,} protein, metabolite, and other component networks. Together these networks give rise to emergent properties of cellular function, and it is their reprogramming that causes disease. We present 5 observations regarding how systems biology is guiding a revisiting of the central dogma: (1) It deemphasizes the unidirectional flow of information from genes to proteins; (2) it reveals the role of modules of molecules as opposed to individual proteins acting in isolation; (3) it enables discovery of novel emergent properties; (4) it demonstrates the importance of networks in biology; and (5) it adds new dimensionality to the study of biological systems.},
