  abstract={We have studied promoter clearance at a series of {RNA} polymerase {II} promoters with varying spacing of the {TATA} box and start site. We find that regardless of promoter spacing, the upstream edge of the transcription bubble forms 20 bp from {TATA.} The bubble expands downstream until 18 bases are unwound and the {RNA} is at least 7 nt long, at which point the upstream approximately 8 bases of the bubble abruptly reanneal (bubble collapse). If either bubble size or transcript length is insufficient, bubble collapse cannot occur. Bubble collapse coincides with the end of the requirement for the {TFIIH} helicase for efficient transcript elongation. We also provide evidence that bubble collapse suppresses pausing at +7 to +9 caused by the presence of the B finger segment of {TFIIB} within the complex. Our results indicate that bubble collapse defines the {RNA} polymerase {II} promoter clearance transition.},

  abstract={We have analyzed transcription initiation by {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} in a highly efficient in vitro transcription system composed of essentially homogeneous protein preparations. The pol {II} complex was stalled on adenovirus major late promoter templates at defined positions, and the open region and {RNA} products of these complexes were examined. The first transition is formation of the open complex, which can be reversed by addition of {ATPgammaS.} The open region is no longer sensitive to {ATPgammaS} after formation of a four-nucleotide {RNA,} which constitutes the second transition. This indicates that the {ATP-dependent} {DNA} helicase activity of {TFIIH} is required to maintain the open region only during formation of the first three phosphodiester bonds. The downstream part of the transcription bubble expands in a continuous motion, but the initially opened region (-9/-2 on the non-template strand) recloses abruptly when transcription reaches register 11. This third transition is accompanied by a switch from abortive to productive {RNA} synthesis, which implies promoter clearance. Our findings provide a framework to analyze regulation of these specific transitions during transcription initiation by pol {II.}},

  abstract={Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has a crucial coregulator function in transcription by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II).} However, the molecular mechanisms of its action in vivo remain to be understood. Med17 is an essential and central component of the Mediator head module. In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex {(PIC)} formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation proposed to be equivalent to the human {Med17-L371P} responsible for infantile cerebral atrophy was also analyzed. The {ChIP-seq} results demonstrate that med17 mutations differentially affected the global presence of several {PIC} components including Mediator, {TBP,} {TFIIH} modules and Pol {II.} Our data show that Mediator stabilizes {TFIIK} kinase and {TFIIH} core modules independently, suggesting that the recruitment or the stability of {TFIIH} modules is regulated independently on yeast genome. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to {TBP} recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. This study provides an extensive genome-wide view of Mediator's role in {PIC} formation, suggesting that Mediator coordinates multiple steps of a {PIC} assembly pathway.},

  abstract={Cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} are synthesized from intra- and intergenic regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are rapidly degraded by {RNA} surveillance pathways, but their function(s) remain(s) elusive. Here, we show that an antisense {TY1} {CUT,} starting within the Ty1 retrotransposon and encompassing the promoter 5' long terminal repeat {(LTR),} mediates {RNA-dependent} gene silencing and represses Ty1 mobility. We show that the Ty1 regulatory {RNA} is synthesized by {RNA} polymerase {II,} polyadenylated, and destabilized by the cytoplasmic 5' {RNA} degradation pathway. Moreover, the Ty1 regulatory {RNA} represses Ty1 transcription and transposition in trans by acting on the de novo transcribed {TY1} {RNA.} Consistent with a transcriptional regulation mechanism, we show that {RNA} polymerase {II} occupancy is reduced on the Ty1 chromatin upon silencing, although {TBP} binding remains unchanged. Furthermore, the Ty1 silencing is partially mediated by histone deacetylation and requires Set1-dependent histone methylation, pointing out an analogy with heterochromatin gene silencing. Our results show the first example of an {RNA-dependent} gene trans-silencing mediated by epigenetic marks in S. cerevisiae.},

Our previous results demonstrated that transcription of {SER3} is tightly repressed during growth in rich medium9. We now show that the regulatory region of this gene is highly transcribed under these conditions and produces a non-protein-coding {RNA} {(SRG1).} Expression of the {SRG1} {RNA} is required for repression of {SER3.} Additional experiments have demonstrated that repression occurs by a transcription-interference mechanism in which {SRG1} transcription across the {SER3} promoter interferes with the binding of activators.

According to the "torpedo" model, the 5'-3' exonuclease {Rat1p/Xrn2p} attacks the newly formed 5' end of the cleaved {pre-mRNA,} causing the still transcribing {RNAPII} to terminate. Here we demonstrate a similar role of S. cerevisiae Rat1p within the gene body. We find that the transcription processivity defect imposed on {RNAPII} by the {rpb1-N488D} mutation is corrected upon Rat1p inactivation. Importantly, Rat1p-dependent transcription termination occurs upstream the polyadenylation site. Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that {mRNA} capping is defective in {rpb1-N488D} cells, which leads to increased levels of Rat1p all along the gene locus. Consistently, Rat1p-dependent {RNAPII} termination is also observed in the capping-deficient ceg1-63 strain. Our data suggest that Rat1p serves to terminate {RNAPII} molecules engaged in the production of uncapped {RNA,} regardless of their position on the gene locus.},

As transcription termination is intimately linked to {RNA} 3' end processing, termination pathways have a key decisive influence on the fate of the transcribed {RNA.} Quite remarkably, when reaching the 3' end of genes, a substantial fraction of {RNAPII} fail to terminate transcription, requiring the contribution of alternative or "fail-safe" mechanisms of termination to release the polymerase. This point of view covers redundant mechanisms of transcription termination and how they relate to conventional termination models. In particular, we expand on recent findings that propose a reverse torpedo model of termination, in which the 3'5' exonucleolytic activity of the {RNA} exosome targets transcription events associated with paused and backtracked {RNAPII.}},

  abstract={The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revealed that pervasive transcription generates {RNAs} from nearly all regions of eukaryotic genomes. Normally, these transcripts undergo rapid degradation by a nuclear {RNA} surveillance system primarily featuring the {RNA} exosome. This multimeric protein complex plays a critical role in the efficient turnover and processing of a vast array of {RNAs} in the nucleus. Despite its initial discovery over a decade ago, important questions remain concerning the mechanisms that recruit and activate the nuclear exosome. Specificity and modulation of exosome activity requires additional protein cofactors, including the conserved {TRAMP} polyadenylation complex. Recent studies suggest that helicase and {RNA-binding} subunits of {TRAMP} direct {RNA} substrates for polyadenylation, which enhances their degradation by {Dis3/Rrp44} and Rrp6, the two exosome-associated ribonucleases. These findings indicate that the exosome and {TRAMP} have evolved highly flexible functions that allow recognition of a wide range of {RNA} substrates. This flexibility provides the nuclear {RNA} surveillance system with the ability to regulate the levels of a broad range of coding and noncoding {RNAs,} which results in profound effects on gene expression, cellular development, gene silencing, and heterochromatin formation. This review summarizes recent findings on the nuclear {RNA} surveillance complexes, and speculates upon possible mechanisms for {TRAMP-mediated} substrate recognition and exosome activation.},

  abstract={In different phases of the transcription cycle, {RNA} polymerase {(Pol)} {II} recruits various factors via its C-terminal domain {(CTD),} which consists of conserved heptapeptide repeats with the sequence {Tyr(1)-Ser(2)-Pro(3)-Thr(4)-Ser(5)-Pro(6)-Ser(7).} We show that the {CTD} of transcribing yeast Pol {II} is phosphorylated at Tyr(1), in addition to Ser(2), Thr(4), Ser(5), and Ser(7). Tyr(1) phosphorylation stimulates binding of elongation factor Spt6 and impairs recruitment of termination factors Nrd1, Pcf11, and Rtt103. Tyr(1) phosphorylation levels rise downstream of the transcription start site and decrease before the polyadenylation site, largely excluding termination factors from gene bodies. These results show that {CTD} modifications trigger and block factor recruitment and lead to an extended {CTD} code that explains transcription cycle coordination on the basis of differential phosphorylation of Tyr(1), Ser(2), and Ser(5).},

  abstract={Nab3 is an {RNA-binding} protein whose function is important for terminating transcription by {RNA} polymerase {II.} It co-assembles with Nrd1, and the resulting heterodimer of these heterogeneous nuclear {ribonucleoprotein-C} {(hnRNP)-like} proteins interacts with the nascent transcript and {RNA} polymerase {II.} Previous genetic analysis showed that a short carboxyl-terminal region of Nab3 is functionally important for termination and is located far from the Nab3 {RNA} recognition domain in the primary sequence. The domain is structurally homologous to {hnRNP-C} from higher organisms. Here we provide biochemical evidence that this short region is sufficient to enable self-assembly of Nab3 into a tetrameric form in a manner similar to the cognate region of human {hnRNP-C.} Within this region, there is a stretch of low complexity protein sequence (16 glutamines) adjacent to a putative {\&\#x3B1;-helix} that potentiates the ability of the conserved region to self-assemble. The glutamine stretch and the final 18 amino acids of Nab3 are both important for termination in living yeast cells. The findings herein describe an additional avenue by which these {hnRNP-like} proteins can polymerize on target transcripts. This process is independent of, but acts in concert with, the interactions of the proteins with {RNA} and {RNA} polymerase and extends the relationship of Nab3 as a functional orthologue of a higher eukaryotic {hnRNP.}},

However, the mechanism of Sen1 function is not understood. We created a plasmid-based genetic system to study yeast Sen1 in vivo. Using this system, we show that (1) the minimal essential region of Sen1 corresponds to the helicase domain and one of two flanking nuclear localization sequences; (2) a previously isolated terminator readthrough mutation in the Sen1 helicase domain, {E1597K,} is rescued by a second mutation designed to restore a salt bridge within the first {RecA} domain; and (3) the human ortholog of yeast Sen1, Senataxin, cannot functionally replace Sen1 in yeast. Guided by sequence homology between the conserved helicase domains of Sen1 and Senataxin, we tested the effects of 13 missense mutations that cosegregate with the inherited disorder ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 on Sen1 function. Ten of the disease mutations resulted in transcription readthrough of at least one of three Sen1-dependent termination elements tested. Our genetic system will facilitate the further investigation of structure-function relationships in yeast Sen1 and its orthologs.},

  abstract={Termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} transcription is associated with {RNA} 3' end formation. For coding genes, termination is initiated by the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. In contrast, a majority of noncoding transcription events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not rely on {RNA} cleavage for termination but instead terminates via a pathway that requires the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} complex. Here we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog of Nrd1, Seb1, does not function in {NNS-like} termination but promotes polyadenylation site selection of coding and noncoding genes. We found that Seb1 associates with 3' end processing factors, is enriched at the 3' end of genes, and binds {RNA} motifs downstream from cleavage sites. Importantly, a deficiency in Seb1 resulted in widespread changes in 3' untranslated region {(UTR)} length as a consequence of increased alternative polyadenylation. Given that Seb1 levels affected the recruitment of conserved 3' end processing factors, our findings indicate that the conserved {RNA-binding} protein Seb1 cotranscriptionally controls alternative polyadenylation.},

We construct a complete pipeline for the analysis of single cell {qPCR} data that uses the mathematics behind bursty expression to develop more accurate and robust algorithms for analyzing the origin of heterogeneity in experimental samples, specifically an algorithm for clustering cells by their bursting behavior {(Simulated} Annealing for Bursty Expression Clustering, {SABEC)} and a statistical tool for comparing the kinetic parameters of bursty expression across populations of cells {(Estimation} of Parameter changes in Kinetics, {EPiK).} We applied these methods to hematopoiesis, including a new single cell dataset in which transcription factors {(TFs)} involved in the earliest branchpoint of blood differentiation were individually up- and down-regulated. We could identify two unique sub-populations within a seemingly homogenous group of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, we could predict regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression levels of eighteen key hematopoietic transcription factors throughout differentiation. Detailed information about gene regulatory mechanisms can therefore be obtained simply from high throughput single cell gene expression data, which should be widely applicable given the rapid expansion of single cell genomics.},

  abstract={{RNA} Polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} transcription termination by the {Nrd1p-Nab3p-Sen1p} {(NNS)} pathway is critical for the production of stable non-coding {RNAs} and for the control of pervasive transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To uncover determinants that specify the precise locations of {NNS} termination, we mapped the 3'-ends of {NNS-terminated} transcripts genome-wide. We found that nucleosomes and various {DNA-binding} proteins, including Pol {III} transcription factors and the general regulatory factors {(GRFs)} Reb1p, Rap1p, and Abf1p, enhance the efficiency of {NNS} termination by physically blocking Pol {II} progression. Intriguingly, the same {DNA-bound} factors that promote {NNS} termination were shown previously to define the 3'-ends of Okazaki fragments during {DNA} replication. We demonstrate that abrogating {DNA} binding of these factors results in defective {NNS} termination and Pol {II} readthrough. Furthermore, inactivating {NNS} enables Pol {II} elongation through the same roadblocks, demonstrating that effective Pol {II} termination depends on a synergy between the {NNS} machinery and obstacles in chromatin. Consistent with this finding, loci exhibiting Pol {II} readthrough at {GRF} binding sites are depleted for upstream {NNS} signals. Overall, these results underscore how {RNA} termination signals influence the behavior of Pol {II} at chromatin obstacles and establish that common genomic elements define boundaries for both {DNA} and {RNA} synthesis machineries.},

  abstract={Termination of {RNA} polymerase (pol) {II} transcription in vivo requires the {5'-RNA} exonuclease Rat1. It was proposed that Rat1 degrades {RNA} from the 5'-end that is created by transcript cleavage, catches up with elongating pol {II,} and acts like a Torpedo that removes pol {II} from {DNA.} Here we test the Torpedo model in an in vitro system based on bead-coupled pol {II} elongation complexes {(ECs).} Recombinant Rat1 complexes with Rai1, and with Rai1 and Rtt103, degrade {RNA} extending from the {EC} until they reach the polymerase surface but fail to terminate pol {II.} Instead, the {EC} retains an approximately 18-nucleotide {RNA} that remains with its 3'-end at the active site and can be elongated. Thus, pol {II} termination apparently requires a factor or several factors in addition to Rat1, Rai1, and Rtt103, post-translational modifications of these factors, or unusual reaction conditions.},

This model has been questioned because unprocessed transcripts read all the way to the site of transcriptional termination before upstream polyadenylation. However, nascent transcripts located 1 kilobase downstream of the human beta-globin gene {poly(A)} signal are associated with a co-transcriptional cleavage {(CoTC)} activity that acts with the {poly(A)} signal to elicit efficient transcriptional termination. The {CoTC} sequence is an autocatalytic {RNA} structure that undergoes rapid self-cleavage. Here we show that {CoTC} acts as a precursor to termination by presenting a free {RNA} 5' end that is recognized by the human 5' --\&gt; 3' exonuclease Xrn2. Degradation of the downstream cleavage product by Xrn2 results in transcriptional termination, as envisaged in the torpedo model.},

Single-molecule methods provide efficient ways to investigate protein dynamics, although it is very challenging to achieve a millisecond or higher temporal resolution. Here we report spontaneous structural dynamics of the histone protein core in the nucleosome based on a single-molecule method that can reveal submillisecond dynamics by combining maximum likelihood estimation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The nucleosome, comprising {\&\#x223C;147} bp {DNA} and an octameric histone protein core consisting of {H2A,} {H2B,} H3, and H4, is the fundamental packing unit of the eukaryotic genome. The nucleosome imposes a physical barrier that should be overcome during various {DNA-templated} processes. Structural fluctuation of the nucleosome in the histone core has been hypothesized to be required for nucleosome disassembly but has yet to be directly probed. Our results indicate that at 100 {mM} {NaCl} the histone {H2A-H2B} dimer dissociates from the histone core transiently once every 3.6 {\&\#xB1;} 0.6 ms and returns to its position within 2.0 {\&\#xB1;} 0.3 ms.

Improving predictions may be dependent on expanding the set of bona fide {TF} binding alterations. Allele-specific binding {(ASB)} events, where {TFs} preferentially bind to one of the two alleles at heterozygous sites, reveal the impact of sequence variations in altered {TF} binding. Here, we present the largest {ASB} compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 {ASB} events retrieved from 45 {ENCODE} {ChIP-Seq} data sets. Our analysis showed that {ASB} events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the {ChIP'ed} {TF} and potential partner {TFs,} allelic difference of {DNase} I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For {TF} dimers bound symmetrically to {DNA,} {ASB} data revealed that central positions of the {TF} binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on {TF} binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of {ASB} events. Classification models using only {DNase} I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features. Taken together, the combination of {ASB} data and the classification model represents an important step toward elucidating regulatory variants across the human genome.},

Rtr1 is a conserved protein that colocalizes with {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} and has been shown to be important for the transition from elongation to termination during transcription by removing {RNAPII} {CTD} serine 5 phosphorylation {(Ser5-P)} at a selection of target genes. In this study, we show that Rtr1 is a global regulator of the {CTD} code with deletion of {RTR1} causing genome-wide changes in {Ser5-P} {CTD} phosphorylation and cotranscriptional histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation {(H3K36me3).} Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-resolution microarrays, we show that {RTR1} deletion results in global changes in {RNAPII} {Ser5-P} levels on genes with different lengths and transcription rates consistent with its role as a {CTD} phosphatase. Although {Ser5-P} levels increase, the overall occupancy of {RNAPII} either decreases or stays the same in the absence of {RTR1} Additionally, the loss of Rtr1 in vivo leads to increases in {H3K36me3} levels genome-wide, while total histone H3 levels remain relatively constant within coding regions. Overall, these findings suggest that Rtr1 regulates {H3K36me3} levels through changes in the number of binding sites for the histone methyltransferase Set2, thereby influencing both the {CTD} and histone codes.},

During late mitosis and G1 replication origins are "licensed" by loading {MCM2-7} double hexamers and during S phase licensed replication origins activate to initiate bidirectional replication forks. Replication forks can stall irreversibly, and if two converging forks stall with no intervening licensed origin-a "double fork stall" {(DFS)-replication} cannot be completed by conventional means. We previously showed how the distribution of replication origins in yeasts promotes complete genome replication even in the presence of irreversible fork stalling. This analysis predicts that {DFSs} are rare in yeasts but highly likely in large mammalian genomes. Here we show that complementary strand synthesis in early mitosis, ultrafine anaphase bridges, and G1-specific p53-binding protein 1 {(53BP1)} nuclear bodies provide a mechanism for resolving unreplicated {DNA} at {DFSs} in human cells. When origin number was experimentally altered, the number of these structures closely agreed with theoretical predictions of {DFSs.} The {53BP1} is preferentially bound to larger replicons, where the probability of {DFSs} is higher. Loss of {53BP1} caused hypersensitivity to licensing inhibition when replication origins were removed. These results provide a striking convergence of experimental and theoretical evidence that unreplicated {DNA} can pass through mitosis for resolution in the following cell cycle.},

The {ORC} binding profile is broader than those of sequence-specific transcription factors, suggesting that {ORC} is not bound or recruited to specific {DNA} sequences. Instead, {ORC} binds nonspecifically to open {(DNase} I-hypersensitive) regions containing active chromatin marks such as H3 acetylation and {H3K4} methylation. {ORC} sites in early and late replicating regions have similar properties, but there are far more {ORC} sites in early replicating regions. This suggests that replication timing is due primarily to {ORC} density and stochastic firing of origins. Computational simulation of stochastic firing from identified {ORC} sites is in accord with replication timing data. Large genomic regions with a paucity of {ORC} sites are strongly associated with common fragile sites and recurrent deletions in cancers. We suggest that replication origins, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks are determined primarily by the genomic distribution of activator proteins at enhancers and promoters. These activators recruit nucleosome-modifying complexes to create the appropriate chromatin structure that allows {ORC} binding and subsequent origin firing.},

Xrn2 nuclease inactivation caused strong termination defects downstream of most {poly(A)} sites and modest delays at some histone and U {snRNA} genes, suggesting that the torpedo mechanism is not limited to {poly(A)} site-dependent termination.

Nucleases including {Xrn2/Rat1} and the nuclear exosome have been shown to play an important role in the turnover of aberrant {mRNAs.} Recently, with the growing appreciation that {mRNA} processing occurs concomitantly with {polII} {(RNA} polymerase {II)} transcription, it has become evident that {QC} acts at the transcriptional level in addition to degrading aberrant {RNAs.} In the present review, we discuss mechanisms that allow cells to co-transcriptionally initiate the removal of {RNAs} as well as down-regulate transcription of transcripts where processing repeatedly fails.},

  abstract={Within a complex with Rai1, the 5'-3' exoribonuclease Rat1 promotes termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} on protein-coding genes, but its underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. Using in vitro transcription termination assays, we have found that {RNAPII} is prone to more effective termination by {Rat1/Rai1} when its catalytic site is disrupted due to {NTP} misincorporation, implying that paused {RNAPII,} which is often found in vivo near termination sites, could adopt a similar configuration to {Rat1/Rai1} and trigger termination. Intriguingly, yeast {Rat1/Rai1} does not terminate Escherichia coli {RNAP,} implying that a specific interaction between {Rat1/Rai1} and {RNAPII} may be required for termination. Furthermore, the efficiency of termination increases as the {RNA} transcript undergoing degradation by Rat1 gets longer, which suggests that Rat1 may generate a driving force for dissociating {RNAPII} from the template while degrading the nascent transcripts to catch up to the polymerase. These results indicate that multiple mechanistic features contribute to Rat1-mediated termination of {RNAPII.}},

In order to gain insight into the biological significance of this code, several studies recently reported the genome-wide distribution of some of these modified polymerases and associated factors in either fission yeast {(Schizosaccharomyces} pombe) or budding yeast {(Saccharomyces} cerevisiae).

  abstract={Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary {DNA} strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable {(SUTs,} stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable {(CUTs,} cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable {ncRNAs} {(CUTs),} so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable {ncRNAs} {(SUTs),} presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense {RNA} in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome.},

Nonetheless, a complete understanding of the complexity of the {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription cycle necessitated the development of assays that include chromatinized {DNA} templates. At this time, the field was actively searching for factors that allow transcription initiation on chromatinized templates. We began studies using chromatin templates in an attempt to identify factor(s) that permit {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes, i.e. that allow elongation on chromatinized {DNA} templates. The challenge herein was to develop an assay that directly measured the ability of transcriptionally engaged {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes. This approach resulted in the isolation of {FACT,} a heterodimer in humans comprised of Spt16 and {SSRP1.} Defined functional biochemical assays corroborated genetic studies in yeast that allowed the elucidation of {FACT} function in vivo. Collectively, these approaches demonstrate that {FACT} is a factor that allows {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo by removing one {H2A/H2B} dimer. More recent studies using a fully defined chromatin reconstitution/transcription assay revealed that {FACT} activity is greatly stimulated by post-translational modification of the histone polypeptides, specifically by monoubiquitination of lysine 120 of human histone {H2B.}},

  abstract={Until recently, it was generally assumed that essentially all regulation of transcription takes place via regions adjacent to the coding region of a gene--namely promoters and enhancers--and that, after recruitment to the promoter, the polymerase simply behaves like a machine, quickly "reading the gene." However, over the past decade a revolution in this thinking has occurred, culminating in the idea that transcript elongation is extremely complex and highly regulated and, moreover, that this process significantly affects both the organization and integrity of the genome. This review addresses basic aspects of transcript elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} and how it relates to other {DNA-related} processes.},

  abstract={The entry of {RNA} polymerase {II} into a productive mode of elongation is controlled, in part, by the postinitiation activity of positive transcription elongation factor b {(P-TEFb)} {(Marshall,} N. F., and Price, D. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 12335-12338). We report here that removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain {(CTD)} of the large subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II} abolishes productive elongation. Correspondingly, we found that {P-TEFb} can phosphorylate the {CTD} of pure {RNA} polymerase {II.} Furthermore, {P-TEFb} can phosphorylate the {CTD} of {RNA} polymerase {II} when the polymerase is in an early elongation complex. Both the function and kinase activity of {P-TEFb} are blocked by the drugs 5, {6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole} {(DRB)} and H-8. {P-TEFb} is distinct from transcription factor {IIH} {(TFIIH)} because the two factors have no subunits in common, {P-TEFb} is more sensitive to {DRB} than is {TFIIH,} and most importantly, {TFIIH} cannot substitute functionally for {P-TEFb.} We propose that phosphorylation of the {CTD} by {P-TEFb} controls the transition from abortive into productive elongation mode.},

Yeast elongation complexes blocked by incorporation of {3'-O-methyl-GTP} into the nascent transcript exhibited a sedimentation coefficient of {35S,} were less tightly associated to the template than their human counterparts, and displayed no detectable 3'-5' exonuclease activity on the associated transcript. In contrast, blocked human elongation complexes were more tightly bound to the template, and multiple forms were identified, with the largest exhibiting a sedimentation coefficient of {60S.} Analysis of the associated transcripts revealed that a subset of the human elongation complexes exhibited strong 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Although isolated human preinitiation complexes were competent for efficient transcription, their ability to generate {60S} elongation complexes was strikingly impaired. These findings demonstrate functional and size differences between S. cerevisiae and human {RNAPII} elongation complexes and support the view that the formation of mature elongation complexes involves recruitment of nuclear factors after the initiation of transcription.},

  abstract={In the gene expression field, different steps have been traditionally viewed as discrete and unconnected events. Nowadays, genetic and functional studies support the model of a coupled network of physical and functional connections to carry out {mRNA} biogenesis. Gene expression is a coordinated process that comprises different linked steps like transcription, {RNA} processing, export to the cytoplasm, translation and degradation of {mRNAs.} Its regulation is essential for cellular survival and can occur at many different levels. Transcription is the central function that occurs in the nucleus, and {RNAPII} plays an essential role in {mRNA} biogenesis. During transcription, nascent {mRNA} is associated with the {mRNA-binding} proteins involved in processing and export of the {mRNA} particle. Cells have developed a network of multi-protein complexes whose functions regulate the different factors involved both temporally and spatially. This coupling mechanism acts as a quality control to solve some of the organization problems of gene expression in vivo, where all the factors implicated ensure that {mRNAs} are ready to be exported and translated. In this review, we focus on the functional coupling of gene transcription and {mRNA} export, and place particular emphasis on the relationship between the {NPC-associated} complex, {TREX2,} and the transcription co-activator, {SAGA.} We have pinpointed the experimental evidence for Sus1's roles in transcription initiation, transcription elongation and {mRNA} export. In addition, we have reviewed other {NPC-related} processes such as gene gating to the nuclear envelope, the chromatin structure and the cellular context in which these processes take place.

  abstract={Efficient maintenance of chromatin structure during passage of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} is critical for cell survival and functioning. Moderate-level transcription of eukaryotic genes by Pol {II} is accompanied by nucleosome survival, extensive exchange of histones {H2A/H2B} and minimal exchange of histones {H3/H4.} Complementary in vitro studies have shown that transcription through chromatin by single Pol {II} complexes is uniquely coupled with nucleosome survival via formation of a small intranucleosomal {DNA} loop {(\&\#xD8;-loop)} containing the transcribing enzyme. In contrast, transient displacement and exchange of all core histones are observed during intense transcription. Indeed, multiple transcribing Pol {II} complexes can efficiently overcome the high nucleosomal barrier and displace the entire histone octamer in vitro. Thus, various Pol {II} complexes can remodel chromatin to different extents. The mechanisms of nucleosome survival and displacement during transcription and the role of {DNA-histone} interactions and various factors during this process are discussed.

  abstract={The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating expression of most {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} transcripts, which include protein-coding and most non-coding {RNA} genes. Mediator and pol {II} function within the pre-initiation complex {(PIC),} which consists of Mediator, pol {II,} {TFIIA,} {TFIIB,} {TFIID,} {TFIIE,} {TFIIF} and {TFIIH} and is approximately 4.0 {MDa} in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the {PIC} and helps regulate pol {II} activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, {DNA-binding} transcription factors {(TFs)} that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from {TFs} directly to the pol {II} enzyme, thereby facilitating {TF-dependent} regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by {TFs)} to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to {mRNA} processing. We also describe factors that influence Mediator structure and activity, including {TFs,} non-coding {RNAs} and the {CDK8} module.},

We found that creating a region of heteroduplex {DNA} around the start site of the adenovirus major late {(AdML)} promoter circumvents the requirement for {TFIIE} and {TFIIH} in transcription. The critical size and position of the heteroduplex region that alleviates the requirement for {TFIIE} and {TFIIH} is six nucleotides, from -4 to +2. Promoter opening was investigated directly with potassium permanganate {(KMnO4),} a chemical probe specific for single-stranded thymidines. We found that {KMnO4-detectable} opening of the {AdML} promoter requires the presence of the complete pre-initiation complex, {DBpolFEH,} and that opening occurs in two discrete steps. First, dependent on {ATP} but prior to initiation, the -9 to +1 region becomes single-stranded. Second, formation of the first phosphodiester bond results in expansion of the open region to the +8 position. Our results lead to a model in which the critical function of the {TFIIH-associated} {DNA} helicases is to create a single-stranded region. This gives {RNA} polymerase {II} access to the nucleotides of the template strand and allows expansion of the open region upon formation of the first phosphodiester bond.},

We found that all three forms of Pol {II} can complement Pol {II-depleted} extracts for transcription initiation, but Pol {II-TFIIF} has the highest specific activity. Similarly, Pol {II-TFIIF} has a much higher specific activity than {TFIIF} for complementation of {TFIIF} transcription activity. Although the Pol {II-TFIIF} and Pol {II-Med} complexes were stable when purified, we found these complexes were dynamic in extracts under transcription conditions, with a single polymerase capable of exchanging bound Mediator and {TFIIF.} Using a purified system to examine transcription reinitiation, we found that Pol {II-TFIIF} was active in promoting multiple rounds of transcription while Pol {II-Med} was nearly inactive.

The comprehensive collection of more than 2500 cooperative {TF} pairs was retrieved from 17 existing algorithms in the literature.

  abstract={In yeast, inducible genes such as {INO1,} {PRM1} and {HIS4} reposition from the nucleoplasm to nuclear periphery upon activation. This leads to a physical interaction with nuclear pore complex {(NPC),} interchromosomal clustering, and stronger transcription. Repositioning to the nuclear periphery is controlled by cis-acting transcription factor {(TF)} binding sites located within the promoters of these genes and the {TFs} that bind to them. Such elements are both necessary and sufficient to control positioning of genes to the nuclear periphery. We have identified four {TFs} capable of controlling the regulated positioning of genes to the nuclear periphery in budding yeast under different conditions: Put3, Cbf1, Gcn4 and Ste12. In each case, we have defined the molecular basis of regulated relocalization to the nuclear periphery. Put3- and Cbf1-mediated targeting to nuclear periphery is regulated through local recruitment of {Rpd3(L)} histone deacetylase complex by transcriptional repressors. {Rpd3(L),} through its histone deacetylase activity, prevents {TF-mediated} gene positioning by blocking {TF} binding. Many yeast transcriptional repressors were capable of blocking Put3-mediated recruitment; 11 of these required Rpd3. Thus, it is a general function of transcription repressors to regulate {TF-mediated} recruitment. However, Ste12 and Gcn4-mediated recruitment is regulated independently of {Rpd3(L)} and transcriptional repressors. Ste12-mediated recruitment is regulated by phosphorylation of an inhibitor called Dig2, and Gcn4-mediated gene targeting is up-regulated by increasing Gcn4 protein levels. The ability to control spatial position of genes in yeast represents a novel function for {TFs} and different regulatory strategies provide dynamic control of the yeast genome through different time scales.},

How the replication machinery progresses along a {DNA} molecule occupied by an {RNA} polymerase is an old question. Here we review recent data on the biological relevance of transcription-replication conflicts, and the factors and mechanisms that are involved in either preventing or resolving them, mainly in eukaryotes. On the basis of these data, we provide our current view of how transcription can generate obstacles to replication, including torsional stress and {non-B} {DNA} structures, and of the different cellular processes that have evolved to solve them.},

  abstract={Identification of genomic regulatory elements is essential for understanding the dynamics of cellular processes. This task has been substantially facilitated by the availability of genome sequences for many species and high-throughput data of transcripts and transcription factor {(TF)} binding. However, rigorous computational methods are necessary to derive accurate genome-wide annotations of regulatory sites from such data. {SwissRegulon} (http://swissregulon.unibas.ch) is a database containing genome-wide annotations of regulatory motifs, promoters and {TF} binding sites {(TFBSs)} in promoter regions across model organisms. Its binding site predictions were obtained with rigorous Bayesian probabilistic methods that operate on orthologous regions from related genomes, and use explicit evolutionary models to assess the evidence of purifying selection on each site. New in the current version of {SwissRegulon} is a curated collection of 190 mammalian regulatory motifs associated with {\&\#x223C;340} {TFs,} and {TFBS} annotations across a curated set of {\&\#x223C;35} 000 promoters in both human and mouse. Predictions of {TFBSs} for Saccharomyces cerevisiae have also been significantly extended and now cover 158 of yeast's {\&\#x223C;180} {TFs.} All data are accessible through both an easily navigable genome browser with search functions, and as flat files that can be downloaded for further analysis.},

  abstract={{ATP-dependent} chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin structure during multiple stages of transcription. We report that {RSC,} an essential chromatin remodeler, is recruited to the open reading frames {(ORFs)} of actively transcribed genes genome wide, suggesting a role for {RSC} in regulating transcription elongation. Consistent with such a role, Pol {II} occupancy in the {ORFs} of weakly transcribed genes is drastically reduced upon depletion of the {RSC} catalytic subunit Sth1. {RSC} inactivation also reduced histone H3 occupancy across transcribed regions. Remarkably, the strongest effects on Pol {II} and H3 occupancy were confined to the genes displaying the greatest {RSC} {ORF} enrichment. Additionally, {RSC} recruitment to the {ORF} requires the activities of the {SAGA} and {NuA4} {HAT} complexes and is aided by the activities of the Pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1. Overall, our findings strongly implicate {ORF-associated} {RSC} in governing Pol {II} function and in maintaining chromatin structure over transcribed regions.},

Where Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 cross-linked broadly to promoter {DNA} in an {RPG-specific} manner and demarcated by general minor groove widening. Importantly, Hmo1 extended 20-50 base pairs (bp) downstream from Fhl1. Upon {RPG} repression, Fhl1 remained in place. Hmo1 dissociated, which was coupled to an upstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, as reflected by the Hmo1 extension and core promoter region. Fhl1 and Hmo1 may create two regulatable and positionally distinct barriers, against which chromatin remodelers position the +1 nucleosome into either an activating or a repressive state. Consistent with in vitro studies, we found that specific {TFIID} subunits, in addition to cross-linking at the core promoter, made precise cross-links at Rap1 sites, which we interpret to reflect native {Rap1-TFIID} interactions.

Swr1 is required for the deposition of histone {H2AZ} at specific chromosome locations in vivo, and Swr1 and {H2AZ} commonly regulate a subset of yeast genes.

The {ATPases} of this family are encoded by 27 human genes and are usually associated with several other proteins that are stable, non-exchangeable subunits. One fundamental mechanism used by these complexes is thought to be the movement or exchange of nucleosomes to regulate transcription. However, recent genetic studies indicate that chromatin remodelers may also be involved in regulating other aspects of chromatin structure during many cellular processes. The {SWI/SNF} family in particular appears to have undergone a substantial change in subunit composition and mechanism coincident with the evolutionary advent of multicellularity and the appearance of linking histones. The differential usage of this greater diversity of mammalian {BAF} subunits is essential for the development of specific cell fates, including the progression from pluripotency to multipotency to committed neurons. Recent human genetic screens have revealed that {BRG1,} {ARID1A,} {BAF155,} and {hSNF5} are frequently mutated in tumors, indicating that {BAF} complexes also play a critical role in the initiation or progression of cancer. The mechanistic bases underlying the genetic requirements for {BAF} and other chromatin remodelers in development and cancer are relatively unexplored and will be a focus of this review.},

The {SWI/SNF} remodelers can be classified into at least two distinct subfamilies: one includes human {BAF} (also known as {hSWI/SNF-A)} and yeast {SWI/SNF;} the other comprises human {PBAF} {(hSWI/SNF-B)} and yeast {RSC.} Although both types of complexes have similar subunit composition and chromatin remodeling activity in vitro, they cannot replace each other during transcription mediated by specific activators.

Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the {H2A.Z-H2B} dimer, is essential for activation of {SWR1.} We found that {SWR1} primarily recognizes key residues within the {\&\#x3B1;2} helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone {H2A,} a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, {SWR1} interacts preferentially with nucleosomal {DNA} at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site.

The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the {TATA} box and the initiator {(INR)} remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for {TATA-less} genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that approximately 76\% of human core promoters lack {TATA-like} elements, have a high {GC} content, and are enriched in Sp1-binding sites. We further identify two motifs - M3 {(SCGGAAGY)} and M22 {(TGCGCANK)} - that occur preferentially in human {TATA-less} core promoters. About 24\% of human genes have a {TATA-like} element and their promoters are generally {AT-rich;} however, only approximately 10\% of these {TATA-containing} promoters have the canonical {TATA} box {(TATAWAWR).} In contrast, approximately 46\% of human core promoters contain the consensus {INR} {(YYANWYY)} and approximately 30\% are {INR-containing} {TATA-less} genes. Significantly, approximately 46\% of human promoters lack both {TATA-like} and consensus {INR} elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type {INR} sequences are present - and tend to cluster - in the transcription start site {(TSS)} region of approximately 40\% of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that {TATA-less} genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic "housekeeping" processes, while {TATA-containing} genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli. These results reveal unexpected similarities in the occurrence of specific core promoter types and in their associated biological processes in yeast and humans and point to novel vertebrate-specific {DNA} motifs that might play a selective role in {TATA-independent} transcription.},

However, less is known about the functional consequences of this encoding. Here, we address this question using a genome-wide map of approximately 380,000 yeast nucleosomes that we sequenced in their entirety. Utilizing the high resolution of our map, we refine our understanding of how nucleosome organizations are encoded by the {DNA} sequence and demonstrate that the genomic sequence is highly predictive of the in vivo nucleosome organization, even across new nucleosome-bound sequences that we isolated from fly and human. We find that {Poly(dA:dT)} tracts are an important component of these nucleosome positioning signals and that their nucleosome-disfavoring action results in large nucleosome depletion over them and over their flanking regions and enhances the accessibility of transcription factors to their cognate sites. Our results suggest that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to regulate gene expression with different transcriptional noise and activation kinetics and {DNA} replication with different origin efficiency. These distinct functions may be achieved by encoding both relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations over some factor binding sites, where factors must compete with nucleosomes for {DNA} access, and relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) organizations over other factor sites, where factors bind without competition.},

Our results unravel several architectural features of yeast core promoters and suggest that the yeast core promoter sequence downstream of the {TATA} box (or of similar sequences involved in recruitment of the pre-initiation complex) is a major determinant of maximal promoter activity.

Stronger defects in promoter escape are linked to stronger effects on preinitiation complex formation and transcription, suggesting that impairment in promoter escape results in premature dissociation of general factors and Pol {II} near the promoter. Kin28 has a stronger effect on genes whose transcription is dependent on {SAGA} as opposed to {TFIID.\&\#xA0;Strikingly,} Kin28 depletion causes a dramatic increase in Mediator at the core promoter. These observations suggest that {TFIIH} phosphorylation {of\&\#xA0;the} {CTD} causes Mediator dissociation, thereby permitting rapid promoter escape of Pol {II} from the preinitiation complex.},

  abstract={Formation of the {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} open complex {(OC)} requires {DNA} unwinding mediated by the transcription factor {TFIIH} helicase-related subunit {XPB/Ssl2.} Because {XPB/Ssl2} binds {DNA} downstream from the location of {DNA} unwinding, it cannot function using a conventional helicase mechanism. Here we show that yeast {TFIIH} contains an Ssl2-dependent double-stranded {DNA} translocase activity. Ssl2 tracks along one {DNA} strand in the 5' \&\#x2192; 3' direction, implying it uses the nontemplate promoter strand to reel downstream {DNA} into the Pol {II} cleft, creating torsional strain and leading to {DNA} unwinding. Analysis of the Ssl2 and {DNA-dependent} {ATPase} activity of {TFIIH} suggests that Ssl2 has a processivity of approximately one {DNA} turn, consistent with the length of {DNA} unwound during transcription initiation. Our results can explain why maintaining the {OC} requires continuous {ATP} hydrolysis and the function of {TFIIH} in promoter escape. Our results also suggest that {XPB/Ssl2} uses this translocase mechanism during {DNA} repair rather than physically wedging open damaged {DNA.}},

These observations have raised questions about whether the functions of the two complexes in vivo are unique or overlapping. Here we use genome-wide expression analysis to investigate how expression of the yeast genome depends on both shared and unique subunits of these two complexes. We find that expression of most genes requires one or more of the common {TAF(II)} subunits, indicating that the functions of {TFIID} and {SAGA} are widely required for gene expression. Among the subunits shared by {TFIID} and {SAGA} are three histone-like {TAF(II)s,} which have been proposed to form a sub-complex and mediate a common function in global transcription. Unexpectedly, we find that the histone-like {TAF(II)s} have distinct roles in expression of the yeast genome. Most importantly, we show that the histone acetylase components of {TFIID} and {SAGA} {(TAF(II)145} and Gcn5) are functionally redundant, indicating that expression of a large fraction of yeast genes can be regulated through the action of either complex.},

We find that while {TFIID} and {SAGA} make overlapping contributions to the expression of all genes, {TFIID} function predominates at approximately 90\% and {SAGA} at approximately 10\% of the measurable genome. Strikingly, {SAGA-dominated} genes are largely stress induced and {TAF} independent, and are downregulated by the coordinate action of a variety of chromatin, {TBP,} and {RNA} polymerase {II} regulators. In contrast, the {TFIID-dominated} class is less regulated, but is highly dependent upon {TAFs,} including those shared between {TFIID} and {SAGA.} These two distinct modes of transcription regulation might reflect the need to balance inducible stress responses with the steady output of housekeeping genes.},

Transcription factor {IID} {(TFIID),} the {TBP-containing} coactivator that functions at most {TATA-less} genes, recognizes short sequence-specific promoter elements in metazoans, but analogous promoter elements have not been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generated a set of mutations in the yeast {TBP} {DNA} binding surface and found that most support growth of yeast. Both in vivo and in vitro, many of these mutations are specifically defective for transcription of two {TATA-containing} genes with only minor defects in transcription of two {TATA-less,} {TFIID-dependent} genes. {TBP} binds several {TATA-less} promoters with apparent high affinity, but our results suggest that this binding is not important for transcription activity. Our results are consistent with the model that sequence-specific {TBP-DNA} contacts are not important at yeast {TATA-less} genes and suggest that other general transcription factors or coactivator subunits are responsible for recognition of {TATA-less} promoters.

  abstract={Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in molecular biology, biochemistry, and other biosciences utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics; genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies; structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology. The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming, as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses, phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as that of a "variable," the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between two {DNA} sequences.},

This induces critical conformational changes in the heart of the enzyme that trigger termination.

  abstract={Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNA} polymerase {(Pol)} {II} locates transcription start sites {(TSS)} at {TATA-containing} promoters by scanning sequences downstream from the site of preinitiation complex formation, a process that involves the translocation of downstream promoter {DNA} toward Pol {II.} To investigate a potential role of yeast Pol {II} transcription in {TSS} scanning, {HIS4} promoter derivatives were generated that limited transcripts in the 30-bp scanned region to two nucleotides in length. Although we found that {TSS} scanning does not require {RNA} synthesis, our results revealed that transcription in the purified yeast basal system is largely {ATP-independent} despite a requirement for the {TFIIH} {DNA} translocase subunit Ssl2. This result is rationalized by our finding that, although they are poorer substrates, {UTP} and {GTP} can also be utilized by Ssl2. {ATP\&\#x3B3;S} is a strong inhibitor of {rNTP-fueled} translocation, and high concentrations of {ATP\&\#x3B3;S} make transcription completely dependent on added {dATP.} Limiting Pol {II} function with low {ATP} concentrations shifted the {TSS} position downstream. Combined with prior work, our results show that Pol {II} transcription plays an important role in {TSS} selection but is not required for the scanning reaction.},

Sen1 has also been shown to protect the yeast genome from transcription-associated recombination by resolving {RNA:DNA} hybrids naturally formed during transcription. Here, we show that the N-terminal non-essential region of Sen1 plays an important role in {TCR,} whereas the C-terminal nonessential region and the helicase activity of Sen1 are largely dispensable for the repair. Unlike Rad26, which becomes completely dispensable for {TCR} in cells lacking the {TCR} repressor Spt4, Sen1 is still required for efficient {TCR} in the absence of Spt4. Also unlike Rad26, which is important for repair at many but not all damaged sites in the transcribed strand of a gene, Sen1 is required for efficient repair at essentially all the damaged sites.

Approximately 1\% of single point mutations in the gene were beneficial and 42\% were deleterious. Almost half of all mutation pairs exhibited statistically significant epistasis, which had a strong negative bias, except when the mutations occurred at {Watson-Crick} paired sites. Fitness was broadly correlated with the predicted fraction of correctly folded transfer {RNA} {(tRNA)} molecules, thereby revealing a biophysical basis of the fitness landscape.},

  abstract={Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} is an important tool for studying gene regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and histones. Peak calling is one of the first steps in the analysis of these data. Peak calling consists of two sub-problems: identifying candidate peaks and testing candidate peaks for statistical significance. We surveyed 30 methods and identified 12 features of the two sub-problems that distinguish methods from each other. We picked six methods {GEM,} {MACS2,} {MUSIC,} {BCP,} Threshold-based method {(TM)} and {ZINBA]} that span this feature space and used a combination of 300 simulated {ChIP-seq} data sets, 3 real data sets and mathematical analyses to identify features of methods that allow some to perform better than the others. We prove that methods that explicitly combine the signals from {ChIP} and input samples are less powerful than methods that do not. Methods that use windows of different sizes are more powerful than the ones that do not. For statistical testing of candidate peaks, methods that use a Poisson test to rank their candidate peaks are more powerful than those that use a Binomial test. {BCP} and {MACS2} have the best operating characteristics on simulated transcription factor binding data. {GEM} has the highest fraction of the top 500 peaks containing the binding motif of the immunoprecipitated factor, with 50\% of its peaks within 10 base pairs of a motif. {BCP} and {MUSIC} perform best on histone data. These findings provide guidance and rationale for selecting the best peak caller for a given application.},

  abstract={The cycle of eukaryotic transcription, from initiation to elongation and termination is regulated at multiple steps. Coordinated action of regulatory factors keeps in check the transcriptional competence of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} at different stages. Productive transcription requires the escape of the paused {RNAPII} from the promoter and transition to rapid elongation of the transcript. Numerous studies have identified diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter. The general theme that has emerged is that the balance between positive and negative regulatory factors determines the overall rate of transcription. Recently transcription termination has emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation that is coupled with the efficient recycling of {RNAPII.} The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation. This review highlights these regulatory steps, the key modulators involved in transcription dynamics, and the emerging tools to analyze them.},

Once loaded, polymerase either remains in the initiation form (with some probability) or transitions into an elongating form (with the remaining probability). The model can be fit genome-wide, allowing patterns of Pol {II} behavior to be assessed on each distinct transcript. Furthermore, it allows for the first time a principled approach to distinguishing the initiation signal from the elongation signal; in particular, it implies a data driven method for calculating the pausing index, a commonly used metric that informs on the behavior of {RNA} polymerase {II.} We demonstrate that this approach improves on existing analyses of {GRO-seq} data and uncovers a novel biological understanding of the impact of knocking down the Male Specific Lethal {(MSL)} complex in Drosophilia melanogaster.},

  abstract={Recent work suggests that {DNA} replication origins are regulated by the number of multiple mini-chromosome maintenance {(MCM)} complexes loaded. Origins are defined by the loading of {MCM} - the replicative helicase which initiates {DNA} replication and replication kinetics determined by origin's location and firing times. However, activation of {MCM} is heterogeneous; different origins firing at different times in different cells. Also, more {MCMs} are loaded in G1 than are used in S phase. These aspects of {MCM} biology are explained by the observation that multiple {MCMs} are loaded at origins. Having more {MCMs} at early origins makes them more likely to fire, effecting differences in origin efficiency that define replication timing. Nonetheless, multiple {MCM} loading raises new questions, such as how they are loaded, where these {MCMs} reside at origins, and how their presence affects replication timing. In this review, we address these questions and discuss future avenues of research.},

  abstract={Growth condition perturbation or gene function disruption are commonly used strategies to study cellular systems. Although it is widely appreciated that such experiments may involve indirect effects, these frequently remain uncharacterized. Here, analysis of functionally unrelated Saccharyomyces cerevisiae deletion strains reveals a common gene expression signature. One property shared by these strains is slower growth, with increased presence of the signature in more slowly growing strains. The slow growth signature is highly similar to the environmental stress response {(ESR),} an expression response common to diverse environmental perturbations. Both environmental and genetic perturbations result in growth rate changes. These are accompanied by a change in the distribution of cells over different cell cycle phases. Rather than representing a direct expression response in single cells, both the slow growth signature and {ESR} mainly reflect a redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases, primarily characterized by an increase in the G1 population. The findings have implications for any study of perturbation that is accompanied by growth rate changes. Strategies to counter these effects are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={De-novo reverse-engineering of genome-scale regulatory networks is a fundamental problem of biological and translational research. One of the major obstacles in developing and evaluating approaches for de-novo gene network reconstruction is the absence of high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions. To establish a foundation for assessing the accuracy of de-novo gene network reverse-engineering, we constructed high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporate binding and gene knockout data. Then we used 7 performance metrics to assess accuracy of 18 statistical association-based approaches for de-novo network reverse-engineering in 13 different datasets spanning over 4 data types. We found that most reconstructed networks had statistically significant accuracies. We also determined which statistical approaches and datasets/data types lead to networks with better reconstruction accuracies. While we found that de-novo reverse-engineering of the entire network is a challenging problem, it is possible to reconstruct sub-networks around some transcription factors with good accuracy. The latter transcription factors can be identified by assessing their connectivity in the inferred networks. Overall, this study provides the gene network reverse-engineering community with a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of S. cerevisiae gene network reconstruction and variability in performance of various approaches for learning both the entire network and sub-networks around transcription factors.},

  abstract={To understand the factor interactions of transcribing {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNApII)} in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitations were used to map the crosslinking patterns of multiple elongation and polyadenylation factors across transcribed genes. Transcription through the polyadenylation site leads to a reduction in the levels of the Ctk1 kinase and its associated phosphorylation of the {RNApII} C-terminal domain. One group of elongation factors {(Spt4/5,} {Spt6/Iws1,} and {Spt16/Pob3),} thought to mediate transcription through chromatin, shows patterns matching that of {RNApII.} In contrast, the Paf and {TREX/THO} complexes partially overlap {RNApII,} but do not crosslink to transcribed regions downstream of polyadenylation sites. In a complementary pattern, polyadenylation factors crosslink strongly at the 3' ends of genes. Mutation of the 3' polyadenylation sequences or the Rna14 protein causes loss of polyadenylation factor crosslinking and read-through of termination sequences. Therefore, transcription termination and polyadenylation involve transitions at the 3' end of genes that may include an exchange of elongation and polyadenylation/termination factors.},

Recent work has shown that these transcripts originate from two distinct core promoters within a single nucleosome free region {(NFR).} Different levels of forward and reverse activity lead to a wide range of directionality for promoter {NFRs.} Importantly, directionality is also reflected in the epigenetic modifications of nucleosomes immediately adjacent to the {NFR.} Here, we review the current literature pertaining to divergent transcription from promoter {NFRs} and its association with combinatorial histone posttranslational modifications, or chromatin states, on upstream and downstream nucleosomes.

The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop {(FFL)} types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 {FFLs} that likely represent feedback.

  abstract={The co-transcriptional biogenesis of export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles {(mRNPs)} in yeast is under the surveillance of quality control {(QC)} steps. Aberrant {mRNPs} resulting from inappropriate or inefficient processing and packaging reactions are detected by the {QC} system and retained in the nucleus with ensuing elimination of their {mRNA} component by a mechanism that requires the catalytic activity of Rrp6p, a 3'-5' exonuclease associated with the {RNA} exosome. In previous studies, we implemented a new experimental approach in which the production of aberrant {mRNPs} is massively increased upon perturbation of {mRNP} biogenesis by the {RNA-dependent} helicase/translocase activity of the bacterial Rho factor expressed in S. cerevisiae. The analyses of a subset of transcripts such as {PMA1} led us to substantiate the essential role of Rrp6p in the nuclear {mRNP} {QC} and to reveal a functional coordination of the process by Nrd1p. Here, we extended those results by showing that, in contrast to {PMA1,} Rho-induced aberrant {HXK1} {mRNPs} are targeted for destruction by an Nrd1p- and Rrp6p-independent alternative {QC} pathway that relies on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Rat1p. We show that the degradation of aberrant {HXK1} {mRNPs} by Rat1p occurs co-transcriptionally following decapping by Dcp2p and leads to premature transcription termination. We discuss the possibility that this alternative {QC} pathway might be linked to the well-known specific features of the {HXK1} gene transcription such as its localization at the nuclear periphery and gene loop formation.},

To systematically survey a model landscape of intragenic epistasis, we quantified the fitness of {{\textasciitilde}60,000Saccharomyces} cerevisiaestrains expressing randomly mutated variants of the 333-nt long U3 {snoRNA.} The fitness effects of individual mutations were correlated with evolutionary conservation and structural stability. Many mutations had small individual effects, but large effects in the context of additional mutations, indicating negative epistasis. Clusters of negative interactions were explained by local thermodynamic threshold effects, whereas positive interactions were enriched among large-effect sites and between base-paired nucleotides. We conclude that high-throughput mapping of intragenic epistasis can identify key structural and functional features of macromolecules.},

  abstract={The small number of molecules, unevenly distributed within an isogenic cell population, makes gene expression a noisy process, and strategies have evolved to deal with this variability in protein concentration and to limit its impact on cellular behaviors. As translational efficiency has a major impact on biological noise, a possible strategy to control noise is to regulate gene expression processes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, fluctuations in the concentration of a green fluorescent protein were compared, at the single cell level, upon transformation of an isogenic bacterial cell population with synthetic gene circuits implementing either a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Experimental measurements showed that protein variability is lower under post-transcriptional control, when the same average protein concentrations are compared. This effect is well reproduced by stochastic simulations, supporting the hypothesis that noise reduction is due to the control mechanism acting on the efficiency of translation. Similar strategies are likely to play a role in noise reduction in natural systems and to be useful for controlling noise in synthetic biology applications.},

Rather, protein-protein interactions between the {TTD} with the Rpa12 subunit of {RNA} pol I seem to be an integral part of the mechanism.

In addition, mapping the 3' ends of {RNA} molecules to the genome after high-throughput sequencing is challenging, particularly if the 3' ends contain post-transcriptional modifications. To address these problems, we developed {EnD-Seq,} a high-throughput sequencing protocol that preserves the 3' end of {RNA} molecules, and {AppEnD,} a computational method for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Together these allow determination of the 3' ends of {RNA} molecules, including nontemplated additions. Applying {EnD-Seq} and {AppEnD} to histone {mRNAs} revealed that a significant fraction of cytoplasmic histone {mRNAs} end in one or two uridines, which have replaced the 1-2 nt at the 3' end of mature histone {mRNA} maintaining the length of the histone transcripts. Histone {mRNAs} in fly embryos and ovaries show the same pattern, but with different tail nucleotide compositions. We increase the sensitivity of {EnD-Seq} by using {cDNA} priming to specifically enrich low-abundance tails of known sequence composition allowing identification of degradation intermediates. In addition, we show the broad applicability of our computational approach by using {AppEnD} to gain insight into 3' additions from diverse types of sequencing data, including data from small capped {RNA} sequencing and some alternative polyadenylation protocols.},

Loss of small silencing {RNAs} or components in their pathways often leads to severe developmental defects, including lethality and sterility. Recently, non-templated addition of nucleotides to the 3' end, namely tailing, was found to associate with the processing and stability of small silencing {RNAs.} Next Generation Sequencing has made it possible to detect such modifications at nucleotide resolution in an unprecedented throughput. Unfortunately, detecting such events from millions of short reads confounded by sequencing errors and {RNA} editing is still a tricky problem. Here, we developed a computational framework, Tailor, driven by an efficient and accurate aligner specifically designed for capturing the tailing events directly from the alignments without extensive post-processing. The performance of Tailor was fully tested and compared favorably with other general-purpose aligners using both simulated and real datasets for tailing analysis. Moreover, to show the broad utility of Tailor, we used Tailor to reanalyze published datasets and revealed novel findings worth further experimental validation.

Here, we report that site-specific replication termination in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is modulated by protein-mediated interactions between pairs of Ter sites located either on the same or on different chromosomes. The dimeric Reb1 protein catalyzes termination and mediates interaction between Ter sites. The Reb1-dependent interactions between two antiparallel Ter sites in cis caused looping out of the intervening {DNA} in vitro and enhancement of fork arrest in vivo. A Ter site on chromosome 2 interacted pairwise with two Ter sites located on chromosome 1 by chromosome kissing.

  abstract={Nucleosomes in all eukaryotes examined to date adopt a characteristic architecture within genes and play fundamental roles in regulating transcription, yet the identity and precise roles of many of the trans-acting factors responsible for the establishment and maintenance of this organization remain to be identified. We profiled a compendium of 50 yeast strains carrying conditional alleles or complete deletions of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, histone biology, and chromatin remodeling, as well as compounds that target transcription and histone deacetylases, to assess their respective roles in nucleosome positioning and transcription. We find that nucleosome patterning in genes is affected by many factors, including the {CAF-1} complex, Spt10, and Spt21, in addition to previously reported remodeler {ATPases} and histone chaperones. Disruption of these factors or reductions in histone levels led genic nucleosomes to assume positions more consistent with their intrinsic sequence preferences, with pronounced and specific shifts of the +1 nucleosome relative to the transcription start site. These shifts of +1 nucleosomes appear to have functional consequences, as several affected genes in Ino80 mutants exhibited altered expression responses. Our parallel expression profiling compendium revealed extensive transcription changes in intergenic and antisense regions, most of which occur in regions with altered nucleosome occupancy and positioning. We show that the nucleosome-excluding transcription factors Reb1, Abf1, Tbf1, and Rsc3 suppress cryptic transcripts at their target promoters, while a combined analysis of nucleosome and expression profiles identified 36 novel transcripts that are normally repressed by {Tup1/Cyc8.} Our data confirm and extend the roles of chromatin remodelers and chaperones as major determinants of genic nucleosome positioning, and these data provide a valuable resource for future studies.},

Chromatin immunoprecipitation-exo, an emerging technique using {\&\#x3BB;} exonuclease to digest {TF} unbound {DNA} after {ChIP,} is designed to reveal transcription factor binding site {(TFBS)} boundaries with near-single nucleotide resolution.

Here we describe a novel analysis framework, termed {MACE} (model-based analysis of {ChIP-exo)} dedicated to {ChIP-exo} data analysis. The {MACE} workflow consists of four steps: (i) sequencing data normalization and bias correction; (ii) signal consolidation and noise reduction; (iii) single-nucleotide resolution border peak detection using the Chebyshev Inequality and (iv) border matching using the {Gale-Shapley} stable matching algorithm. When applied to published human {CTCF,} yeast Reb1 and our own mouse {ONECUT1/HNF6} {ChIP-exo} data, {MACE} is able to define {TFBSs} with high sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution, as evidenced by multiple criteria including motif enrichment, sequence conservation, direct sequence pileup, nucleosome positioning and open chromatin states. In addition, we show that the fundamental advance of {MACE} is the identification of two boundaries of a {TFBS} with high resolution, whereas other methods only report a single location of the same event. The two boundaries help elucidate the in vivo binding structure of a given {TF,} e.g. whether the {TF} may bind as dimers or in a complex with other co-factors.},

  abstract={Chromatin endogenous cleavage {(ChEC)} uses fusion of a protein of interest to micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)} to target calcium-dependent cleavage to specific genomic loci in vivo. Here we report the combination of {ChEC} with high-throughput sequencing {(ChEC-seq)} to map budding yeast transcription factor {(TF)} binding. Temporal analysis of {ChEC-seq} data reveals two classes of sites for {TFs,} one displaying rapid cleavage at sites with robust consensus motifs and the second showing slow cleavage at largely unique sites with low-scoring motifs. Sites with high-scoring motifs also display asymmetric cleavage, indicating that {ChEC-seq} provides information on the directionality of {TF-DNA} interactions. Strikingly, similar {DNA} shape patterns are observed regardless of motif strength, indicating that the kinetics of {ChEC-seq} discriminates {DNA} recognition through sequence and/or shape. We propose that time-resolved {ChEC-seq} detects both high-affinity interactions of {TFs} with consensus motifs and sites preferentially sampled by {TFs} during diffusion and sliding.},

  abstract={Every nucleosome across the genome must be disrupted and reformed when the replication fork passes, but how chromatin organization is re-established following replication is unknown. To address this problem, we have developed Mapping {In\&\#xA0;vivo} Nascent Chromatin with {EdU} and sequencing {(MINCE-seq)} to characterize the genome-wide location of nucleosomes and other chromatin proteins behind replication forks at high temporal and spatial resolution. We find that the characteristic chromatin landscape at Drosophila promoters and enhancers is lost upon replication. The most conspicuous changes are at promoters that have high levels of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} stalling and {DNA} accessibility and show specific enrichment for the {BRM} remodeler. Enhancer chromatin is also disrupted during replication, suggesting a role for transcription factor {(TF)} competition in nucleosome re-establishment. Thus, the characteristic nucleosome landscape emerges from a uniformly packaged genome by the action of {TFs,} {RNAPII,} and remodelers minutes after replication fork passage.},

Previously, we found that the Nrd1 {CID} is required to recruit the nuclear exosome to the Nrd1 complex, but it was not clear which exosome subunits were contacted. Here, we show that two nuclear exosome cofactors, Mpp6 and Trf4, directly and competitively interact with the Nrd1 {CID} and differentially regulate the association of Nrd1 with two catalytic subunits of the exosome. Importantly, Mpp6 promotes the processing of Nrd1-terminated transcripts preferentially by Dis3, whereas Trf4 leads to Rrp6-dependent processing. This suggests that Mpp6 and Trf4 may play a role in choosing a particular {RNA} processing route for Nrd1-terminated transcripts within the exosome by guiding the transcripts to the appropriate exonuclease.},

  abstract={Transcription by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II),} and all {RNA} polymerases for that matter, may be understood as comprising two cycles. The first cycle relates to the basic mechanism of the transcription process wherein Pol {II} must select the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate complementary to the {DNA} template, catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, and translocate to the next position on the {DNA} template. Performing this cycle in an iterative fashion allows the synthesis of {RNA} chains that can be over one million nucleotides in length in some larger eukaryotes. Overlaid upon this enzymatic cycle, transcription may be divided into another cycle of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Each of these phases has a large number of associated transcription factors that function to promote or regulate the gene expression process. Complicating matters, each phase of the latter transcription cycle are coincident with cotranscriptional {RNA} processing events. Additionally, transcription takes place within a highly dynamic and regulated chromatin environment. This chromatin environment is radically impacted by active transcription and associated chromatin modifications and remodeling, while also functioning as a major platform for Pol {II} regulation. This review will focus on our basic knowledge of the Pol {II} transcription mechanism, and how altered Pol {II} activity impacts gene expression in vivo in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Defined, sequence-specific pause sites have been identified biochemically. Single-molecule studies have also shown that bacterial {RNAP} pauses frequently during transcriptional elongation, but the relationship of these "ubiquitous" pauses to the underlying {DNA} sequence has been uncertain. We employed an ultrastable optical-trapping assay to follow the motion of individual molecules of {RNAP} transcribing templates engineered with repeated sequences carrying imbedded, sequence-specific pause sites of known regulatory function. Both the known and ubiquitous pauses appeared at reproducible locations, identified with base-pair accuracy. Ubiquitous pauses were associated with {DNA} sequences that show similarities to regulatory pause sequences. Data obtained for the lifetimes and efficiencies of pauses support a model where the transition to pausing branches off of the normal elongation pathway and is mediated by a common elemental state, which corresponds to the ubiquitous pause.},

We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger {RNA} 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene.

  abstract={Sequence-specific pausing of multisubunit {RNA} polymerases {(RNAPs)} represents a rate-limiting step during transcription elongation. Pausing occurs on average every 100 bases of {DNA.} Several models have been proposed to explain pausing, including backtracking of the ternary elongation complex, delay of translocation of the enzyme along {DNA,} or a conformational change in the active site preventing formation of the phosphodiester bond. Here, we performed biochemical characterization of previously-reported pauses of Escherichia coli {RNAP} and found that they are not associated with backtracking or a translocation delay. Instead, the paused complex contains the 3' end of the transcript in the active center and is capable of binding the next cognate {NTP.} However, bond formation occurs much slower in the paused complex compared with its fully-active counterpart. The pausing is dramatically decreased by a substitution of the base encoding the next incoming {NTP} and the base encoding the 3' end of the nascent {RNA,} suggesting that (mis)-alignment of the 3' end of the {RNA} and the incoming {NTP} in the active site is crucial for pausing. These pause sites are conserved between E. coli and Thermus thermophilus {RNAPs,} but are not recognized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNAP} {II,} indicating that prokaryotic {RNAPs} might be more sensitive to the changes in the alignment of the nascent transcript and the substrate {NTP} in the active site.},

Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal {DNA} sequences, such as {poly(A)} sequences, as well as by binding sites for trans-acting factors that can evict nucleosomes, such as Reb1 and the Rsc3/30 complex. Here, we use genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 Ascomycota fungi to discover large-scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure. We find that {poly(G)s} act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences, comparable to the known function of {poly(A)s,} but that the abundance of {poly(G)s} has diverged greatly between species, obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in {low-poly(G)} species such as S. cerevisiae. We also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans-acting general regulatory factor {(GRF)} binding sites. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by {GRFs} have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of {GRFs.} We experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from Cbf1 as a major {GRF} in pre-whole-genome duplication {(WGD)} yeasts to Reb1 in {post-WGD} yeasts. We further show that the mating type switch-activating protein Sap1 is a {GRF} in S. pombe, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. Our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization.},

In {RSC-depleted} cells, {NFRs} shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. Nucleosome positioning at distinct subsets of promoters additionally requires the essential Myb family proteins Abf1 and Reb1, whose binding sites are enriched in {NFRs.} In contrast, {H2A.Z} deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning. By regulating {H2A.Z} deposition using a steroid-inducible protein splicing strategy, we show that {NFR} establishment is necessary for {H2A.Z} deposition.

Here, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli {RNA} polymerase {(RNAP),} which never encounters chromatin in vivo, behaves similarly to Pol {II} in all aspects of transcription through the nucleosome in vitro. The nucleosome-specific pausing pattern of {RNAP} is comparable with that of Pol {II.} At physiological ionic strength or lower, the nucleosome blocks {RNAP} progression along the template, but this barrier can be relieved at higher ionic strength. Transcription through the nucleosome by {RNAP} results in the loss of an {H2A/H2B} dimer, and the histones that remain in the hexasome retain their original positions on the {DNA.} The results were similar for elongation complexes that were assembled from components (oligonucleotides and {RNAP)} and elongation complexes obtained by initiation from the promoter. The data suggest that eukaryotic Pol {II} and E. coli {RNAP} utilize very similar mechanisms for transcription through the nucleosome. Thus, bacterial {RNAP} can be used as a suitable model system to study general aspects of chromatin transcription by Pol {II.} Furthermore, the data argue that the general elongation properties of polymerases may determine the mechanism used for transcription through the nucleosome.},

  abstract={The assessment of transcriptional regulation requires a genome-wide survey of active {RNA} polymerases. Thus, we combined the nuclear run-on assay, which labels and captures nascent transcripts, with high-throughput {DNA} sequencing to examine transcriptional activity in exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence read data from these nuclear run-on libraries revealed that transcriptional regulation in yeast occurs not only at the level of {RNA} polymerase recruitment to promoters but also at postrecruitment steps. Nascent synthesis signals are strongly enriched at {TSS} throughout the yeast genome, particularly at histone loci. Nascent transcripts reveal antisense transcription for more than 300 genes, with the read data providing support for the activity of distinct promoters driving transcription in opposite directions rather than bidirectional transcription from single promoters. By monitoring total {RNA} in parallel, we found that transcriptional activity accounts for 80\% of the variance in transcript abundance. We computed {RNA} stabilities from nascent and steady-state transcripts for each gene and found that the most stable and unstable transcripts encode proteins whose functional roles are consistent with these stabilities. We also surveyed transcriptional activity after heat shock and found that most, but not all, heat shock-inducible genes increase their abundance by increasing their {RNA} synthesis. In summary, this study provides a genome-wide view of {RNA} polymerase activity in yeast, identifies regulatory steps in the synthesis of transcripts, and analyzes transcript stabilities.},

Together with results of in vitro assays, these data reveal a complex interplay between the modifying enzymes, and provide evidence that the {CTD} cycle is uniform across genes.

  abstract={Pausing of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP} {II)} by backtracking on {DNA} is a major regulatory mechanism in control of eukaryotic transcription. Backtracking occurs by extrusion of the 3' end of the {RNA} from the active center after bond formation and before translocation of {RNAP} {II} on {DNA.} In several documented cases, backtracking requires a special signal such as {A/T-rich} sequences forming an unstable {RNA-DNA} hybrid in the elongation complex. However, other sequence-dependent backtracking signals and conformations of {RNAP} {II} leading to backtracking remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate with S. cerevisiae {RNAP} {II} that a cleavage-deficient elongation factor {TFIIS} {(TFIIS(AA))} enhances backtracked pauses during regular transcription. This is due to increased efficiency of formation of an intermediate that leads to backtracking. This intermediate may involve misalignment at the 3' end of the nascent {RNA} in the active center of the yeast {RNAP} {II,} and {TFIIS(AA)} promotes formation of this intermediate at the {DNA} sequences, presenting a high-energy barrier to translocation. We proposed a three-step mechanism for {RNAP} {II} pausing in which a prolonged dwell time in the pre-translocated state increases the likelihood of the 3' {RNA} end misalignment facilitating a backtrack pausing. These results demonstrate an important role of the intrinsic blocks to forward translocation in pausing by {RNAP} {II.}},

Isw2 possessed a subnucleosomal organization in accord with biochemical and crystallographic-based models that place its linker binding region within promoters and abutted against Reb1-bound locations.

  abstract={Identifying genes in the genomic context is central to a cell's ability to interpret the genome. Yet, in general, the signals used to define eukaryotic genes are poorly described. Here, we derived simple classifiers that identify where transcription will initiate and terminate using nucleic acid sequence features detectable by the yeast cell, which we integrate into a Unified Model {(UM)} that models transcription as a whole. The cis-elements that denote where transcription initiates function primarily through nucleosome depletion, and, using a synthetic promoter system, we show that most of these elements are sufficient to initiate transcription in vivo. Hrp1 binding sites are the major characteristic of terminators; these binding sites are often clustered in terminator regions and can terminate transcription bidirectionally. The {UM} predicts global transcript structure by modeling transcription of the genome using a hidden Markov model whose emissions are the outputs of the initiation and termination classifiers. We validated the novel predictions of the {UM} with available {RNA-seq} data and tested it further by directly comparing the transcript structure predicted by the model to the transcription generated by the cell for synthetic {DNA} segments of random design. We show that the {UM} identifies transcription start sites more accurately than the initiation classifier alone, indicating that the relative arrangement of promoter and terminator elements influences their function. Our model presents a concrete description of how the cell defines transcript units, explains the existence of nongenic transcripts, and provides insight into genome evolution.},

To evaluate these predictions, we analysed transcription through a nucleosome by different, structurally related {RNA} polymerases and mutant yeast Pol {II} having different histone-interacting surfaces that presumably stabilize the {\&\#xD8;-loop.} The height of the nucleosomal barrier to transcription and efficiency of nucleosome survival correlate with the net negative charges of the histone-interacting surfaces.

This paper describes the first selection and identification of {DNA} aptamers able to recognize the biogenic amine tyramine. To successfully isolate aptamers to this challenging small molecule target, the {SELEX} methodology was adapted by combining a systematic strategy to increase the selection stringency and monitor enrichment success. As the benefits of applying high-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} in {SELEX} experiments is becoming more clear, this method was employed in combination with bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the utility of the selection strategy and to uncover new potential high affinity sequences. Based on the presence of consensus regions (sequence families) and family similarities (clusters), 15 putative aptamers to tyramine were identified. A recently described workflow approach to perform a primary screening and characterization of the aptamer candidates by micro-equilibrium dialysis and by microscale thermophoresis was next leveraged. These candidate aptamers exhibited dissociation constant {(Kd)} values in the range of 0.2-152 {\&\#xB5;M} with aptamer Tyr\_10 as the most promising one followed by aptamer Tyr\_14. These aptamers could be used as promising molecular recognition tools for the development of inexpensive, robust and innovative biosensor platforms for the detection of tyramine in food and beverages.},

  abstract={{RNA-Sequencing} {(RNA-seq)} experiments have been popularly applied to transcriptome studies in recent years. Such experiments are still relatively costly. As a result, {RNA-seq} experiments often employ a small number of replicates. Power analysis and sample size calculation are challenging in the context of differential expression analysis with {RNA-seq} data. One challenge is that there are no closed-form formulae to calculate power for the popularly applied tests for differential expression analysis. In addition, false discovery rate {(FDR),} instead of family-wise type I error rate, is controlled for the multiple testing error in {RNA-seq} data analysis. So far, there are very few proposals on sample size calculation for {RNA-seq} experiments.},

  abstract={The C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNA} polymerase {II} in eukaryotes is comprised of tandemly repeating units of a conserved seven amino acid sequence. The number of repeats is, however, quite variable across different organisms. Furthermore, previous studies have identified evidence of rearrangements within the {CTD} coding region suggesting {DNA} instability may play a role in regulating or maintaining {CTD} repeat number. The work described here establishes a clear connection between {DNA} instability and {CTD} repeat number in S. cerevisiae. First, analysis of 36 diverse S. cerevisiae isolates revealed evidence of numerous past rearrangements within the {DNA} sequence that encodes the {CTD.} Interestingly, the total number of {CTD} repeats was relatively static (24-26 repeats in all strains), suggesting a balancing act between repeat expansion and contraction. In an effort to explore the genetic plasticity within this region we measured the rates of repeat expansion and contraction using novel reporters and a doxycycline-regulated expression system for {RPB1.} In efforts to determine the mechanisms leading to {CTD} repeat variability we identified the presence of {DNA} secondary structures, specifically G-quadruplex-like {DNA,} within the {CTD} coding region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutating {PIF1,} a G-quadruplex specific helicase, results in increased {CTD} repeat length polymorphisms. We also determined that {RAD52} is necessary for {CTD} repeat expansion but not contraction, identifying a role for recombination in repeat expansion. Results from these {DNA} rearrangements may help explain the {CTD} copy number variation seen across eukaryotes, as well as support a model of {CTD} expansion and contraction to maintain {CTD} integrity and overall length.},

Nrd1 mutations share some phenotypes with exosome mutants, including increased readthrough transcription from several {mRNA} and {sn/snoRNA} genes.

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} termination is triggered by sequences present in the nascent transcript. Termination of {pre-mRNA} transcription is coupled to recognition of cis-acting sequences that direct cleavage and polyadenylation of the {pre-mRNA.} Termination of nonpolyadenylated {[non-poly(A)]} Pol {II} transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. We have used a mutational strategy to characterize {non-poly(A)} termination elements downstream of the {SNR13} and {SNR47} {snoRNA} genes. This approach detected two common {RNA} sequence motifs, {GUA[AG]} and {UCUU.} The first motif corresponds to the known Nrd1-binding site, which we have verified here by gel mobility shift assays. We also show that Nab3 protein binds specifically to {RNA} containing the {UCUU} motif. Taken together, our data suggest that Nrd1 and Nab3 binding sites play a significant role in defining {non-poly(A)} terminators. As is the case with {poly(A)} terminators, there is no strong consensus for {non-poly(A)} terminators, and the arrangement of Nrd1p and Nab3p binding sites varies considerably. In addition, the organization of these sequences is not strongly conserved among even closely related yeasts. This indicates a large degree of genetic variability. Despite this variability, we were able to use a computational model to show that the binding sites for Nrd1 and Nab3 can identify genes for which transcription termination is mediated by these proteins.},

  abstract={A eukaryotic chromosome contains many genes, each transcribed separately by {RNA} polymerase (pol) I, {II} or {III.} Transcription termination between genes prevents the formation of polycistronic {RNAs} and anti-sense {RNAs,} which are generally detrimental to the correct expression of genes. Terminating the transcription of protein-coding genes by pol {II} requires a group of proteins that also direct cleavage and polyadenylation of the messenger {RNA} in response to a specific sequence element, and are associated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of pol {II} (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). By contrast, the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that direct termination of non-polyadenylated transcripts made by pol {II,} including small nucleolar and small nuclear {RNAs,} are not known. Here we show that read-through transcription from yeast small nucleolar {RNA} and small nuclear {RNA} genes into adjacent genes is prevented by a cis-acting element that is recognized, in part, by the essential {RNA-binding} protein Nrd1. The {RNA-binding} protein Nab3, the putative {RNA} helicase Sen1, and the intact C-terminal domain of pol {II} are also required for efficient response to the element. The same proteins are required for maintaining normal levels of Nrd1 {mRNA,} indicating that these proteins may control elongation of a subset of {mRNA} transcripts.},

The yeast {NRD1} gene encodes an essential {RNA-binding} protein that shares homology with mammalian {CTD-binding} proteins and is thought to regulate {mRNA} abundance by binding to a specific cis-acting element. The present work demonstrates genetic and physical interactions among Nrd1p, the pol {II} {CTD,} Nab3p, and the {CTD} kinase {CTDK-I.} Previous studies have shown that Nrd1p associates with the {CTD} of pol {II} in yeast two-hybrid assays via its {CTD-interaction} domain {(CID).} We show that nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles are synthetically lethal with truncation of the {CTD} to 9 or 10 repeats. Nab3p, a yeast {hnRNP,} is a high-copy suppressor of some nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles, interacts with Nrd1p in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and coimmunoprecipitates with Nrd1p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of {NAB3} are suppressed by deletion of {CTK1,} a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate the {CTD} and increase elongation efficiency in vitro.

Overexpressing a C-terminal fragment of Sen1, a superfamily I helicase required for {snoRNA} termination, suppresses the growth and termination defects associated with loss of Swd2 or Ref2, but not Glc7.

Previous work suggested that the functional Tlc1 {polyA-} {RNA} is processed from the {polyA+} form, but the mechanisms regulating its transcription termination and 3'-end formation remained unclear. Here we examined transcription termination of Tlc1 {RNA} in the sequences 3' of the {TLC1} gene and relate it to telomere maintenance. Strikingly, disruption of all probable or cryptic polyadenylation signals near the 3'-end blocked the accumulation of the previously reported {polyA+} {RNA} without affecting the level, function or specific 3' nucleotide of the mature {polyA-} form. A genetic approach analysing {TLC1} 3'-end sequences revealed that transcription terminates upstream of the polyadenylation sites. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the function of this Tlc1 terminator depends on the {Nrd1/Nab3} transcription termination pathway. The data thus show that transcription termination of the budding yeast telomerase {RNA} occurs as that of {snRNAs} and Tlc1 functions in telomere maintenance are not strictly dependent on a polyadenylated precursor, even if the {polyA+} form can serve as intermediate in a redundant termination/maturation pathway.},

We used single-molecule resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization {(smFISH)} to investigate antisense-mediated transcription regulation. We show that {PHO84} {AS} {RNA} acts as a bimodal switch, in which continuous, low-frequency antisense transcription represses sense expression within individual cells. Surprisingly, antisense {RNAs} do not accumulate at the {PHO84} gene but are exported to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, rather than stabilizing {PHO84} {AS} {RNA,} the loss of Rrp6 favors its elongation by reducing early transcription termination by {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1.} These observations suggest that {PHO84} silencing results from antisense transcription through the promoter rather than the static accumulation of antisense {RNAs} at the repressed gene.},

  abstract={Termination of transcription of short non-coding {RNAs} is carried out in yeast by the {Nab3-Nrd1-Sen1} complex. Nab3 and Nrd1 are {hnRNP-like} proteins that dimerize and bind {RNA} with sequence specificity. We show here that an essential region of Nab3 that is predicted to be prion-like based upon its sequence bias, formed amyloid-like filaments. A similar region from Nrd1 also assembled into filaments in vitro. The purified Nab3 domain formed a macroscopic gel whose lattice organization was observed by X-ray fiber diffraction. Filaments were resistant to dissociation in anionic detergent, bound the fluorescent dye thioflavin T, and showed a {\&\#x3B2;-sheet} rich structure by circular dichroism spectroscopy, similar to human amyloid {\&\#x3B2;} which served as a reference amyloid. A version of the Nab3 domain with a mutation that impairs its termination function, also formed fibers as observed by electron microscopy. Using a protein fragment interaction assay, the purified Nab3 domain was seen to interact with itself in living yeast. A similar observation was made for full length Nab3. These results suggest that the Nab3 and Nrd1 {RNA-binding} proteins can attain a complex polymeric form and raise the possibility that this property is important for organizing their functional state during termination. These findings are congruent with recent work showing that {RNA} binding proteins with low complexity domains form a dynamic subcellular matrix in which {RNA} metabolism takes place but can also aberrantly yield pathological aggregated particles.},

  abstract={The {IMD2} gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by intracellular guanine nucleotides. Regulation is exerted through the choice of alternative transcription start sites that results in synthesis of either an unstable short transcript terminating upstream of the start codon or a full-length productive {IMD2} {mRNA.} Start site selection is dictated by the intracellular guanine nucleotide levels. Here we have mapped the polyadenylation sites of the upstream, unstable short transcripts that form a heterogeneous family of {RNAs} of approximately 200 nucleotides. The switch from the upstream to downstream start sites required the Rpb9 subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II.} The enzyme's ability to locate the downstream initiation site decreased exponentially as the start was moved downstream from the {TATA} box. This suggests that {RNA} polymerase {II's} pincer grip is important as it slides on {DNA} in search of a start site. Exosome degradation of the upstream transcripts was highly dependent upon the distance between the terminator and promoter. Similarly, termination was dependent upon the Sen1 helicase when close to the promoter. These findings extend the emerging concept that distinct modes of termination by {RNA} polymerase {II} exist and that the distance of the terminator from the promoter, as well as its sequence, is important for the pathway chosen.},

  abstract={{RNA-seq} is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An {RNA-seq} experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially expressed {(SDE)} genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to \&gt;85\% for the subset of {SDE} genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve \&gt;85\% for all {SDE} genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at \&\#x2272;5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their {FDR} adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future {RNA-seq} experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify {SDE} genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances {makesedgeRthe} leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important {andDESeqmarginally} outperforms the other tools.},

Inhibition of {pre-mRNA} degradation resulted in increased levels of {pre-mRNAs} and spliced {mRNAs.} When splicing was inhibited by mutation of a splicing factor, inhibition of turnover resulted in 20- to 50-fold accumulation of {pre-mRNAs,} accompanied by increased {mRNA} production. Splicing of a reporter construct with a 3' splice site mutation was also increased on inhibition of turnover, showing competition between degradation and splicing.

To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate {(FDR).} Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets.

Currently, two main experimental challenges concerning {sRNA-seq} exist: how to check the size distribution of isolated {sRNAs,} given the sensitive size-selection steps in the protocol; and how to normalize data between samples, given the low complexity of {sRNA} types. We here present two separate sets of synthetic {RNA} spike-ins for monitoring size-selection and for performing data normalization in {sRNA-seq.} The size-range quality control {(SRQC)} spike-in set, consisting of 11 oligoribonucleotides (10-70 nucleotides), was tested by intentionally altering the size-selection protocol and verified via several comparative experiments. We demonstrate that the {SRQC} set is useful to reproducibly track down biases in the size-selection in {sRNA-seq.} The external reference for data-normalization {(ERDN)} spike-in set, consisting of 19 oligoribonucleotides, was developed for sample-to-sample normalization in differential-expression analysis of {sRNA-seq} data. Testing and applying the {ERDN} set showed that it can reproducibly detect differential expression over a dynamic range of 2(18). Hence, biological variation in {sRNA} composition and content between samples is preserved while technical variation is effectively minimized. Together, both spike-in sets can significantly improve the technical reproducibility of {sRNA-seq.}},

Our results reveal widespread differences in stability among isoforms for hundreds of genes in a single condition, and that variation of even a single nucleotide in the 3' untranslated region {(UTR)} can affect transcript stability. While previous instances of negative associations between 3' {UTR} length and transcript stability have been reported, here, we find that shorter isoforms are not necessarily more stable. We demonstrate the role of {RNA-protein} interactions in conditioning isoform-specific stability, showing that {PUF3} binds and destabilizes specific polyadenylation isoforms. Our findings indicate that although the functional elements of a gene are encoded in {DNA} sequence, the selective incorporation of these elements into {RNA} through transcript boundary variation allows a single gene to have diverse functional consequences.},

In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin-associated gene silencing is known to be mediated by {RNA} processing pathways including {RNA} interference {(RNAi)} and a 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex, the exosome. Here, we report a new {RNA-processing} pathway that contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin mediated by 5'-3' exoribonuclease {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2.} Dhp1 mutation causes defective gene silencing both at peri-centromeric regions and at the silent mating type locus. Intriguingly, mutation in either of the two well-characterized Dhp1-interacting proteins, the Din1 pyrophosphohydrolase or the Rhn1 transcription termination factor, does not result in silencing defects at the main heterochromatic regions. We demonstrate that Dhp1 interacts with heterochromatic factors and is essential in the sequential steps of establishing silencing in a manner independent of both {RNAi} and the exosome. Genomic and genetic analyses suggest that Dhp1 is involved in post-transcriptional silencing of repetitive regions through its {RNA} processing activity. The results describe the unexpected role of {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2} in chromatin-based silencing and elucidate how various {RNA-processing} pathways, acting together or independently, contribute to epigenetic regulation of the eukaryotic genome.},

  abstract={The amount of {mRNA} in a cell is the result of two opposite reactions: transcription and {mRNA} degradation. These reactions are governed by kinetics laws, and the most regulated step for many genes is the transcription rate. The transcription rate, which is assumed to be exercised mainly at the {RNA} polymerase recruitment level, can be calculated using the {RNA} polymerase densities determined either by run-on or immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the ideal model organism to generate a complete set of nascent transcription rates that will prove useful for many gene regulation studies. By combining genomic data from both the {GRO} {(Genomic} Run-on) and the {RNA} pol {ChIP-on-chip} methods we generated a new, more accurate nascent transcription rate dataset. By comparing this dataset with the indirect ones obtained from the {mRNA} stabilities and {mRNA} amount datasets, we are able to obtain biological information about posttranscriptional regulation processes and a genomic snapshot of the location of the active transcriptional machinery. We have obtained nascent transcription rates for 4,670 yeast genes. The median {RNA} polymerase {II} density in the genes is 0.078 molecules/kb, which corresponds to an average of 0.096 molecules/gene. Most genes have transcription rates of between 2 and 30 {mRNAs/hour} and less than 1\% of yeast genes have \&gt;1 {RNA} polymerase molecule/gene. Histone and ribosomal protein genes are the highest transcribed groups of genes and other than these exceptions the transcription of genes is an infrequent phenomenon in a yeast cell.},

  abstract={{ChIP-Seq} is widely used to characterize genome-wide binding patterns of transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins. Although comparison of {ChIP-Seq} data sets is critical for understanding cell type-dependent and cell state-specific binding, and thus the study of cell-specific gene regulation, few quantitative approaches have been developed. Here, we present a simple and effective method, {MAnorm,} for quantitative comparison of {ChIP-Seq} data sets describing transcription factor binding sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding differences inferred by {MAnorm} showed strong correlation with both the changes in expression of target genes and the binding of cell type-specific regulators.},

  abstract={Replication timing is a crucial aspect of genome regulation that is strongly correlated with chromatin structure, gene expression, {DNA} repair, and genome evolution. Replication timing is determined by the timing of replication origin firing, which involves activation of {MCM} helicase complexes loaded at replication origins. Nonetheless, how the timing of such origin firing is regulated remains mysterious. Here, we show that the number of {MCMs} loaded at origins regulates replication timing. We show for the first time in vivo that multiple {MCMs} are loaded at origins. Because early origins have more {MCMs} loaded, they are, on average, more likely to fire early in S phase. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed heterogeneity in origin firing and help to explain how defined replication timing profiles emerge from stochastic origin firing. These results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.},

  abstract={Mapping the chromosomal locations of transcription factors, nucleosomes, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling enzymes, chaperones, and polymerases is one of the key tasks of modern biology, as evidenced by the Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements {(ENCODE)} Project. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} is the standard methodology. Mapping such {protein-DNA} interactions in vivo using {ChIP-seq} presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of {ChIP-seq} data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of {ChIP-seq} data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in {ChIP-seq} data analysis.

Replication initiates stochastically, primarily within non-transcribed, broad (up to 150\&\#x2009;kb) zones that often abut transcribed genes, and terminates dispersively between them. Replication fork progression is significantly co-oriented with the transcription. Initiation and termination zones are frequently contiguous, sometimes separated by regions of unidirectional replication. Initiation zones are enriched in open chromatin and enhancer marks, even when not flanked by genes, and often border 'topologically associating domains' {(TADs).} Initiation zones are enriched in origin recognition complex {(ORC)-binding} sites and better align to origins previously mapped using bubble-trap than {\&\#x3BB;-exonuclease.} This novel panorama of replication reveals how chromatin and transcription modulate the initiation process to create cell-type-specific replication programs.},

Here we show a comprehensive structural characterization of the native {CCR4-NOT} complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our {cryo-EM} {3D} reconstruction of the complex, combined with techniques such as immunomicroscopy, {RNA-nanogold} labelling, docking of the available high-resolution structures and models of different subunits and domains, allow us to propose its full molecular architecture. We locate all functionally defined domains endowed with deadenylating and ubiquitinating activities, the nucleus-specific {RNA-interacting} subunit Mmi1, as well as surfaces responsible for protein-protein interactions.

  abstract={Eukaryotic cells license each {DNA} replication origin during G1 phase by assembling a prereplication complex that contains a Mcm2-7 (minichromosome maintenance proteins 2-7) double hexamer. During S phase, each Mcm2-7 hexamer forms the core of a replicative {DNA} helicase. However, the mechanisms of origin licensing and helicase activation are poorly understood. The helicase loaders {ORC-Cdc6} function to recruit a single {Cdt1-Mcm2-7} heptamer to replication origins prior to Cdt1 release and {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex formation, but how the second Mcm2-7 hexamer is recruited to promote double-hexamer formation is not well understood. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex and an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7} complex are reported, which together provide new insights into {DNA} licensing. Detailed structural analysis of the loaded Mcm2-7 double-hexamer complex demonstrates that the two hexamers are interlocked and misaligned along the {DNA} axis and lack {ATP} hydrolysis activity that is essential for {DNA} helicase activity. Moreover, we show that the head-to-head juxtaposition of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer generates a new protein interaction surface that creates a multisubunit-binding site for an S-phase protein kinase that is known to activate {DNA} replication. The data suggest how the double hexamer is assembled and how helicase activity is regulated during {DNA} licensing, with implications for cell cycle control of {DNA} replication and genome stability.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication is temporally and spatially organized in all eukaryotes, yet the molecular control and biological function of the replication-timing program are unclear. Rif1 is required for normal genome-wide regulation of replication timing, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells, Rif1 coats late-replicating domains and, with Lamin B1, identifies most of the late-replicating genome. Rif1 is an essential determinant of replication timing of {non-Lamin} B1-bound late domains. We further demonstrate that Rif1 defines and restricts the interactions between replication-timing domains during the G1 phase, thereby revealing a function of Rif1 as organizer of nuclear architecture. Rif1 loss affects both number and replication-timing specificity of the interactions between replication-timing domains. In addition, during the S phase, Rif1 ensures that replication of interacting domains is temporally coordinated. In summary, our study identifies Rif1 as the molecular link between nuclear architecture and replication-timing establishment in mammals.},

Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression.

  abstract={The {RNA} exosome complex is the most versatile {RNA-degradation} machine in eukaryotes. The exosome has a central role in several aspects of {RNA} biogenesis, including {RNA} maturation and surveillance. Moreover, it is emerging as an important player in regulating the expression levels of specific {mRNAs} in response to environmental cues and during cell differentiation and development. Although the mechanisms by which {RNA} is targeted to (or escapes from) the exosome are still not fully understood, general principles have begun to emerge, which we discuss in this Review. In addition, we introduce and discuss novel, previously unappreciated functions of the nuclear exosome, including in transcription regulation and in the maintenance of genome stability.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic replication origins are activated at different times during the S phase of the cell cycle, following a temporal program that is stably transmitted to daughter cells. Although the mechanisms that control initiation at the level of individual origins are now well understood, much less is known on how cells coordinate replication at hundreds of origins distributed on the chromosomes. In this review, we discuss recent advances shedding new light on how this complex process is regulated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The picture that emerges from these studies is that replication timing is regulated in cis by mechanisms modulating the chromatin structure and the subnuclear organization of origins. These mechanisms do not affect the licensing of replication origins but determine their ability to compete for limiting initiation factors, which are recycled from early to late origins throughout the length of the S phase.},

  abstract={The mini-chromosome maintenance proteins Mcm2-7 are essential for {DNA} replication. They are loaded onto replication origins during G1 phase of the cell cycle to form a pre-replication complex {(pre-RC)} that licenses each origin for subsequent initiation. We have investigated the {DNA} elements that determine the dependence of yeast replication origins on Mcm2-7 activity, i.e. the sensitivity of an origin to mcm mutations. Using chimaeric constructs from mcm sensitive and mcm insensitive origins, we have identified two main elements affecting the requirement for Mcm2-7 function. First, transcription into an origin increases its dependence on Mcm2-7 function, revealing a conflict between {pre-RC} assembly and transcription. Second, sequence elements within the minimal origin influence its mcm sensitivity. Replication origins show similar differences in sensitivity to mutations in other {pre-RC} proteins (such as Origin Recognition Complex and Cdc6), but not to mutations in initiation and elongation factors, demonstrating that the mcm sensitivity of an origin is determined by its ability to establish a {pre-RC.} We propose that there is a hierarchy of replication origins with respect to the range of {pre-RC} protein concentrations under which they will function. This hierarchy is both 'hard-wired' by the minimal origin sequences and 'soft-wired' by local transcriptional context.},

Here we show that ligation-competent Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the nucleosome repeat. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Our studies represent the first high-resolution analysis--to our knowledge--of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments in vivo, and reveal the interconnection between lagging-strand synthesis and chromatin assembly.},

  abstract={The replication of genomic {DNA} is limited to a single round per cell cycle. The first component, which recognises and remains bound to origins from recognition until activation and replication elongation, is the origin recognition complex. How origin recognition complex {(ORC)} proteins remain associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle is not yet completely understood. Several genome-wide studies have undoubtedly demonstrated that {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP-II)} binding sites overlap with replication origins and with the binding sites of the replication components. {RNAP-II} is no longer merely associated with transcription elongation. Several reports have demonstrated that {RNAP-II} molecules affect chromatin structure, transcription, {mRNA} processing, recombination and {DNA} repair, among others. Most of these activities have been reported to directly depend on the interaction of proteins with the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNAP-II.} Two-dimensional gels results and {ChIP} analysis presented herein suggest that stalled {RNAP-II} molecules bound to the {rDNA} chromatin participate in the anchoring of {ORC} proteins to origins during the G1 and S-phases. The results show that in the absence of {RNAP-II,} Orc1p, Orc2p and Cdc6p do not bind to origins. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that {Ser2P-CTD} and hypophosphorylated {RNAP-II} interact with Orc1p. In the context of {rDNA,} cryptic transcription by {RNAP-II} did not negatively interfere with {DNA} replication. However, the results indicate that {RNAP-II} is not necessary to maintain the binding of {ORCs} to the origins during metaphase. These findings highlight for the first time the potential importance of stalled {RNAP-II} in the regulation of {DNA} replication.},

  abstract={Divergent transcription, in which reverse-oriented transcripts occur upstream of eukaryotic promoters in regions devoid of annotated genes, has been suggested to be a general property of active promoters. Here we show that the human basal {RNA} polymerase {II} transcriptional machinery and core promoter are inherently unidirectional and that reverse-oriented transcripts originate from their own cognate reverse-directed core promoters. In vitro transcription analysis and mapping of nascent transcripts in {HeLa} cells revealed that sequences at reverse start sites are similar to those of their forward counterparts. The use of {DNase} I accessibility to define proximal promoter borders revealed that about half of promoters are unidirectional and that unidirectional promoters are depleted at their upstream edges of reverse core promoter sequences and their associated chromatin features. Divergent transcription is thus not an inherent property of the transcription process but rather the consequence of the presence of both forward- and reverse-directed core promoters.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic genomes are replicated from large numbers of replication origins distributed on multiple chromosomes. The activity of these origins must be coordinated so that the entire genome is efficiently and accurately replicated yet no region of the genome is ever replicated more than once. The past decade has seen significant advances in understanding how the initiation of {DNA} replication is regulated by key cell-cycle regulators, including the cyclin dependent kinases {(CDKs)} and the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome {(APC/C).} The assembly of essential prereplicative complexes {(pre-RCs)} at origins only occurs when {CDK} activity is low and {APC/C} activity is high. Origin firing, however, can only occur when the {APC/C} is inactivated and {CDKs} become active. This two step mechanism ensures that no origin can fire more than once in a cell cycle. In all eukaryotes tested, {CDKs} can contribute to the inhibition of {pre-RC} assembly. This inhibition is characterised both by high degrees of redundancy and evolutionary plasticity. Geminin plays a crucial role in inhibiting licensing in metazoans and, like cyclins, is inactivated by the {APC/C.} Strategies involved in preventing re-replication in different organisms will be discussed.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication is tightly controlled in eukaryotic cells to ensure that an exact copy of the genetic material is inherited by both daughter cells. Oscillating waves of cyclin-dependent kinase {(CDK)} and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome {(APC/C)} activities provide a binary switch that permits the replication of each chromosome exactly once per cell cycle. Work from several organisms has revealed a conserved strategy whereby inactive replication complexes are assembled onto {DNA} during periods of low {CDK} and high {APC} activity but are competent to execute genome duplication only when these activities are reversed. Periods of high {CDK} and low {APC/C} serve an essential function by blocking reassembly of replication complexes, thereby preventing rereplication.

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotic cells initiates from multiple replication origins that are distributed throughout the genome. Coordinating the usage of these origins is crucial to ensure complete and timely replication of the entire genome precisely once in each cell cycle. Replication origins fire according to a cell-type-specific temporal programme, which is established in the G1 phase of each cell cycle. In response to conditions causing the slowing or stalling of {DNA} replication forks, the programme of origin firing is altered in two contrasting ways, depending on chromosomal context. First, inactive or 'dormant' replication origins in the vicinity of the stalled replication fork become activated and, second, the S phase checkpoint induces a global shutdown of further origin firing throughout the genome. Here, we review our current understanding on the role of dormant origins and the S phase checkpoint in the rescue of stalled forks and the completion of {DNA} replication in the presence of replicative stress.},

We find that pre-initiation complex formation is an essentially undirected process, giving rise to a large number of bidirectional promoters and to pervasive antisense transcription. Notably, 12\% of all transcriptionally active positions showed simultaneous activity on both strands. Furthermore, {dsHMM} reveals that antisense transcription is specifically suppressed by Nrd1, a yeast termination factor.},

  abstract={One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors {(TFs)} and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several {TFs,} indicating that {TFs} function synergistically and combinatorially. However, while {TF} binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of {TFs} and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which {TFs} participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different {TFs} form functionally distinct groups, or if certain {TFs} might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of {TFs} and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited {GAL4-DNA-binding-domain} fusions of 812 Drosophila {TFs} and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of {TFs} that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar {TFs} can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging {TF} motifs, and {TF-cofactor} pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of {TFs} and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.},

  abstract={Previous studies indicate that eukaryotic promoters display a stereotypical chromatin landscape characterized by a well-positioned +1 nucleosome near the transcription start site and an upstream -1 nucleosome that together demarcate a nucleosome-free (or -depleted) region. Here we present evidence that there are two distinct types of promoters distinguished by the resistance of the -1 nucleosome to micrococcal nuclease digestion. These different architectures are characterized by two sequence motifs that are broadly deployed at one set of promoters where a nuclease-sensitive ("fragile") nucleosome forms, but concentrated in a narrower, nucleosome-free region at all other promoters. The {RSC} nucleosome remodeler acts through the motifs to establish stable +1 and -1 nucleosome positions, while binding of a small set of general regulatory (pioneer) factors at fragile nucleosome promoters plays a key role in their destabilization. We propose that the fragile nucleosome promoter architecture is adapted for regulation of highly expressed, growth-related genes.},

  abstract={Most mammalian genes produce transcripts whose 3' ends are processed at multiple alternative positions by cleavage/polyadenylation {(CPA).} {Poly(A)} site cleavage frequently occurs co-transcriptionally and is facilitated by {CPA} factor binding to the {RNA} pol {II} C-terminal domain phosphorylated on Ser2 residues of its heptad repeats {(YS2PTSPS).} The function of co-transcriptional events in the selection of alternative {poly(A)} sites is poorly understood. We investigated pol {II} pausing, Ser2 {CTD} phosphorylation and processing factor {CstF} recruitment at {WT} and mutant {IgM} transgenes that use alternative {poly(A)} sites to produce {mRNAs} encoding the secreted and membrane-bound forms of the Ig heavy chain. The results show that the sites of pol {II} pausing and processing factor recruitment change depending on which {poly(A)} site is utilized. In contrast, the extent of pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 phosphorylation did not closely correlate with {poly(A)} site selection. We conclude that changes in properties of the transcription elongation complex closely correlate with utilization of different {poly(A)} sites, suggesting that co-transcriptional events may influence the decision between alternative modes of {pre-mRNA} 3' end processing.},

We analyzed thirty different point mutations in or around {CEN6-CDEI} {(ATCACGTG)} for their relative binding affinity to Cpf1 and these data were compared with the in vivo centromere function of these mutants. We show that the minimal length of the Cpf1 binding site needed for full in vitro binding and in vivo activity is 10 base pairs long comprised of {CDEI} plus the two base pairs 3' of this sequence. The palindromic core sequence {CACGTG} is most important for in vivo {CEN} function and in vitro Cpf1 binding. Symmetrical mutations in either halfsite of the core sequence affect in vitro Cpf1 binding and in vivo mitotic centromere function asymmetrically albeit to a different extent. Enlarging the {CDEI} palindrome to 12 or 20 bps increases in vitro Cpf1 binding but results in increased chromosome loss rates suggesting a need for asymmetrical Cpf1 binding sequences. Additionally, the ability of Cpf1 protein to bind a mutant {CDEI} element in vitro does not parallel the ability of that mutant to confer in vivo {CEN} activity. Our data indicate that the in vitro binding characteristics of Cpf1 to {CDEI} only partly overlap with their corresponding activity within the centromere complex, thus suggesting that in the in vivo situation the {CDEI/Cpf1} complex might undergo interactions with other centromere {DNA/protein} complexes.},

The extension of the transcription complex into this {DNA} segment does suggest two possible explanations for highly diverse effects of flanking-sequence substitutions on {tRNA} gene transcription: either (i) proteins that are capable of binding to these upstream {DNA} segments are also potentially capable of stimulating or interfering with the incorporation of {TFIIIB} into transcription complexes or (ii) 5'-flanking sequence influences the rate of assembly of {TFIIIB} into stable transcription complexes.},

  abstract={The centromere is the genetic locus that organizes the proteinaceous kinetochore and is responsible for attachment of the chromosome to the spindle at mitosis and meiosis. In most eukaryotes, the centromere consists of highly repetitive {DNA} sequences that are occupied by nucleosomes containing the {CenH3} histone variant, whereas in budding yeast, a {\&\#x223C;120-bp} centromere {DNA} element {(CDE)} that is sufficient for centromere function is occupied by a single right-handed histone variant {CenH3} {(Cse4)} nucleosome. However, these in vivo observations are inconsistent with in vitro evidence for left-handed octameric {CenH3} nucleosomes. To help resolve these inconsistencies, we characterized yeast centromeric chromatin at single base-pair resolution. Intact particles containing both Cse4 and {H2A} are precisely protected from micrococcal nuclease over the entire {CDE} of all 16 yeast centromeres in both solubilized chromatin and the insoluble kinetochore. Small {DNA-binding} proteins protect {CDEI} and {CDEIII} and delimit the centromeric nucleosome to the {\&\#x223C;80-bp} {CDEII,} only enough for a single {DNA} wrap. As expected for a tripartite organization of centromeric chromatin, loss of Cbf1 protein, which binds to {CDEI,} both reduces the size of the centromere-protected region and shifts its location toward {CDEIII.} Surprisingly, Cse4 overproduction caused genome-wide misincorporation of nonfunctional {CenH3-containing} nucleosomes that protect {\&\#x223C;135} base pairs and are preferentially enriched at sites of high nucleosome turnover. Our detection of two forms of {CenH3} nucleosomes in the yeast genome, a singly wrapped particle at the functional centromere and octamer-sized particles on chromosome arms, reconcile seemingly conflicting in vivo and in vitro observations.},

  abstract={{"One,} no one and one hundred thousand" is a masterpiece of Italian literature, written by Luigi Pirandello. The central theme is that in each individual there are multiple personalities, since one's perception of one's self differs from the view of others. As a consequence, a unique identity does not exist, but rather one hundred thousand. This concept can be very well applied to the kinetochore, one of the largest macromolecular complexes conserved in eukaryotes. The kinetochore is essential during cell division and fulfills different sophisticated functions, including linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules and delaying anaphase onset in case of incorrect bi-orientation. In order to perform these tasks, the kinetochore shapes its structure by recruiting different subunits, such as the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint {(SAC)} or the monopolin complex during meiosis. It also modifies its internal organization by rearranging intramolecular connections and acquiring a distinct identity at different time points of cell division. In this review, we describe recent insights into the changes in composition and configuration of the kinetochore in mitosis and meiosis, focusing on the kinetochore of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

These structures, far shorter than topologically associating domains in mammals, typically encompass one to five genes in yeast. Strong boundaries between self-associating domains occur at promoters of highly transcribed genes and regions of rapid histone turnover that are typically bound by the {RSC} chromatin-remodeling complex.

  abstract={In yeast, ribosome production is controlled transcriptionally by tight coregulation of the 138 ribosomal protein genes {(RPGs).} {RPG} promoters display limited sequence homology, and the molecular basis for their coregulation remains largely unknown. Here we identify two prevalent {RPG} promoter types, both characterized by upstream binding of the general transcription factor {(TF)} Rap1 followed by the {RPG-specific} {Fhl1/Ifh1} pair, with one type also binding the {HMG-B} protein Hmo1. We show that the regulatory properties of the two promoter types are remarkably similar, suggesting that they are determined to a large extent by Rap1 and the {Fhl1/Ifh1} pair. Rapid depletion experiments allowed us to define a hierarchy of {TF} binding in which Rap1 acts as a pioneer factor required for binding of all other {TFs.} We also uncovered unexpected features underlying recruitment of Fhl1, whose forkhead {DNA-binding} domain is not required for binding at most promoters, and Hmo1, whose binding is supported by repeated motifs. Finally, we describe unusually micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)-sensitive} nucleosomes at all {RPG} promoters, located between the canonical +1 and -1 nucleosomes, which coincide with sites of {Fhl1/Ifh1} and Hmo1 binding. We speculate that these "fragile" nucleosomes play an important role in regulating {RPG} transcriptional output.},

  abstract={A wide variety of large-scale data have been produced in bioinformatics. In response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses because of factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new generations of storage devices have emerged, such as {NAND} flash-based solid-state drives {(SSDs),} and with the renewed interest in near-data processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement of hard disk drives by {SSDs} results in dramatic speedup. Despite the various advantages and continuous cost reduction of {SSDs,} there has been little review of {SSD-based} profiling and performance exploration of important but time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research, we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit {SSDs.} The programs we profile cover traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly, mapping, expression analysis, variant calling and metagenomics. We explain how acceleration by parallelization can be combined with {SSDs} for improved performance and also how using {SSDs} can expedite important bioinformatics pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and transcriptome analysis using {RNA} sequencing. We hope that this review can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful storage devices.},

  abstract={Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small {RNA-sequencing} experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental {RNA-sequencing} data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic {DNA} replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge. Termination involves local completion of {DNA} synthesis, decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. Termination has been difficult to study because termination events are generally asynchronous and sequence nonspecific. To overcome these challenges, we paused converging replisomes with a site-specific barrier in Xenopus egg extracts. Upon removal of the barrier, forks underwent synchronous and site-specific termination, allowing mechanistic dissection of this process. We show that {DNA} synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative {CMG} helicase (comprising {CDC45,} {MCM2-7} and {GINS)} occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of {DNA} synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging {CMGs} pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded {DNA.} This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of {DNA} synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.},

  abstract={Transcription factor {(TF)} binding is determined by the presence of specific sequence motifs {(SM)} and chromatin accessibility, where the latter is influenced by both chromatin state {(CS)} and {DNA} structure {(DS)} properties. Although {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} have been used to predict {TF} binding sites, a predictive model that jointly considers {CS} and {DS} has not been developed to predict either {TF-specific} binding or general binding properties of {TFs.} Using budding yeast as model, we found that machine learning classifiers trained with either {CS} or {DS} features alone perform better in predicting {TF-specific} binding compared to {SM-based} classifiers. In addition, simultaneously considering {CS} and {DS} further improves the accuracy of the {TF} binding predictions, indicating the highly complementary nature of these two properties. The contributions of {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} features to binding site predictions differ greatly between {TFs,} allowing {TF-specific} predictions and potentially reflecting different {TF} binding mechanisms. In addition, a {"TF-agnostic"} predictive model based on three {DNA} "intrinsic properties" (in silico predicted nucleosome occupancy, major groove geometry, and dinucleotide free energy) that can be calculated from genomic sequences alone has performance that rivals the model incorporating experiment-derived data. This intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions not only across {TFs,} but also across {DNA-binding} domain families with distinct structural folds. Furthermore, these predicted binding regions can help identify {TF} binding sites that have a significant impact on target gene expression. Because the intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions across {DNA-binding} domain families, it is {TF} agnostic and likely describes general binding potential of {TFs.} Thus, our findings suggest that it is feasible to establish a {TF} agnostic model for identifying functional regulatory regions in potentially any sequenced genome.},

  abstract={Nrd1 is an essential yeast protein of unknown function that has an {RNA} recognition motif {(RRM)} in its carboxyl half and a putative {RNA} polymerase {II-binding} domain, the {CTD-binding} motif, at its amino terminus. Nrd1 mediates a severe reduction in {pre-mRNA} production from a reporter gene bearing an exogenous sequence element in its intron. The effect of the inserted element is highly sequence-specific and is accompanied by the appearance of 3'-truncated transcripts. We have proposed that Nrd1 binds to the exogenous sequence element in the nascent {pre-mRNA} during transcription, aided by the {CTD-binding} motif, and directs 3'-end formation a short distance downstream. Here we show that highly purified Nrd1 carboxyl half binds tightly to the {RNA} element in vitro with sequence specificity that correlates with the efficiency of cis-element-directed down-regulation in vivo. A large deletion in the {CTD-binding} motif blocks down-regulation but does not affect the essential function of Nrd1. Furthermore, a nonsense mutant allele that produces truncated Nrd1 protein lacking the {RRM} has a dominant-negative effect on down-regulation but not on cell growth. Viability of this and several other nonsense alleles of Nrd1 appears to require translational readthrough, which in one case is extremely efficient. Thus the {CTD-binding} motif of Nrd1 is important for {pre-mRNA} down-regulation but is not required for the essential function of Nrd1. In contrast, the {RNA-binding} activity of Nrd1 appears to be required both for down-regulation and for its essential function.},

Antisense transcription can function as a fast evolving regulatory switch and a modular scaffold for protein complexes, and it can 'rewire' regulatory networks.

  abstract={Dissecting the molecular basis of quantitative traits is a significant challenge and is essential for understanding complex diseases. Even in model organisms, precisely determining causative genes and their interactions has remained elusive, due in part to difficulty in narrowing intervals to single genes and in detecting epistasis or linked quantitative trait loci. These difficulties are exacerbated by limitations in experimental design, such as low numbers of analyzed individuals or of polymorphisms between parental genomes. We address these challenges by applying three independent high-throughput approaches for {QTL} mapping to map the genetic variants underlying 11 phenotypes in two genetically distant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, namely (1) individual analysis of \&gt;700 meiotic segregants, (2) bulk segregant analysis, and (3) reciprocal hemizygosity scanning, a new genome-wide method that we developed. We reveal differences in the performance of each approach and, by combining them, identify eight polymorphic genes that affect eight different phenotypes: colony shape, flocculation, growth on two nonfermentable carbon sources, and resistance to two drugs, salt, and high temperature. Our results demonstrate the power of individual segregant analysis to dissect {QTL} and address the underestimated contribution of interactions between variants. We also reveal confounding factors like mutations and aneuploidy in pooled approaches, providing valuable lessons for future designs of complex trait mapping studies.},

  abstract={The particular behaviour of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerases along different gene regions and amongst distinct gene functional groups is not totally understood. To cast light onto the alternative active or backtracking states of {RNA} polymerase {II,} we have quantitatively mapped active {RNA} polymerases at a high resolution following a new biotin-based genomic run-on {(BioGRO)} technique. Compared with conventional profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation, the analysis of the {BioGRO} profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that {RNA} polymerase {II} has unique activity profiles at both gene ends, which are highly dependent on positioned nucleosomes. This is the first demonstration of the in vivo influence of positioned nucleosomes on transcription elongation. The particular features at the 5' end and around the polyadenylation site indicate that this polymerase undergoes extensive specific-activity regulation in the initial and final transcription elongation phases. The genes encoding for ribosomal proteins show distinctive features at both ends. {BioGRO} also provides the first nascentome analysis for {RNA} polymerase {III,} which indicates that transcription of {tRNA} genes is poorly regulated at the individual copy level. The present study provides a novel perspective of the transcription cycle that incorporates inactivation/reactivation as an important aspect of {RNA} polymerase dynamics.},

  abstract={Mechanisms conferring robustness against regulatory variants have been controversial. Previous studies suggested widespread buffering of {RNA} misexpression on protein levels during translation. We do not find evidence that translational buffering is common. Instead, we find extensive buffering at the level of {RNA} expression, exerted through negative feedback regulation acting in trans, which reduces the effect of regulatory variants on gene expression. Our approach is based on a novel experimental design in which allelic differential expression in a yeast hybrid strain is compared to allelic differential expression in a pool of its spores. Allelic differential expression in the hybrid is due to cis-regulatory differences only. Instead, in the pool of spores allelic differential expression is not only due to cis-regulatory differences but also due to local trans effects that include negative feedback. We found that buffering through such local trans regulation is widespread, typically compensating for about 15\% of cis-regulatory effects on individual genes. Negative feedback is stronger not only for essential genes, indicating its functional relevance, but also for genes with low to middle levels of expression, for which tight regulation matters most. We suggest that negative feedback is one mechanism of Waddington's canalization, facilitating the accumulation of genetic variants that might give selective advantage in different environments.},

Although there are many {NGS} applications, one of the most commonly used techniques {'RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq)'} is rapidly replacing microarray-based techniques in laboratories around the world. As more and more of such techniques are standardized, allowing technicians to perform these experiments with minimal hands-on time and reduced experimental/operator-dependent biases, the bottleneck of such techniques is clearly visible; that is, data analysis. Further complicating the matter, increasing evidence suggests most of the genome is transcribed into {RNA;} however, the majority of these {RNAs} are not translated into proteins. These {RNAs} that do not become proteins are called 'noncoding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)'.} Although some time has passed since the discovery of {ncRNAs,} their annotations remain poor, making analysis of {RNA-seq} data challenging. Here, we examine the current limitations of {RNA-seq} analysis using case studies focused on the detection of novel transcripts and examination of their characteristics. Finally, we validate the presence of novel transcripts using biological experiments, showing novel transcripts can be accurately identified when a series of filters is applied. In conclusion, novel transcripts that are identified from {RNA-seq} must be examined carefully before proceeding to biological experiments.},

  abstract={The hepatitis B virus {(HBV)} particle is an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope containing viral surface proteins. A small domain (matrix domain, {MD)} in the large surface protein L and a narrow region (matrix binding domain, {MBD)} including isoleucine 126 on the capsid surface have been mapped where point mutations like {core-I126A} specifically blocked nucleocapsid envelopment. Possibly, both domains interact with each other during virion morphogenesis. By the {SELEX} method we evolved {DNA} aptamers from an oligonucleotide library binding to purified recombinant capsids but not binding to the corresponding {I126A} mutant capsids. Aptamers bound to capsids were separated from unbound molecules by filtration. After 13 rounds of selections and amplifications 16 different aptamers were found among 73 clones. The four most frequent aptamers represented more than 50 \% of the clones. The main aptamer {AO-01} (13 clones, 18 \%) showed the lowest dissociation constant {(Kd)} of 180 +/- 82 {nM} for capsid binding among the four molecules. Its Kd value for {I126A} capsids was 1306 +/- 503 {nM.} Cotransfection of Huh7 cells with {AO-01} and an {HBV} genomic construct resulted in 47 \% inhibition of virion production 3 days post transfection but showed no inhibition by cotransfection of an aptamer with random sequence. The half-life of {AO-01} in cells was 2 hours which might explain the incomplete inhibition. The results support the importance of the {MBD} for nucleocapsid envelopment. Inhibiting the {MD-MBD} interaction by a low molecular weight substance might represent a new approach for an antiviral therapy.},

  abstract={Due to their high affinity and specificity, aptamers have been widely used as effective inhibitors in clinical applications. However, the ability to activate protein function through aptamer-protein interaction has not been well-elucidated. To investigate their potential as target-specific agonists, we used {SELEX} to generate aptamers to the insulin receptor {(IR)} and identified an agonistic aptamer named {IR-A48} that specifically binds to {IR,} but not to {IGF-1} receptor. Despite its capacity to stimulate {IR} autophosphorylation, similar to insulin, we found that {IR-A48} not only binds to an allosteric site distinct from the insulin binding site, but also preferentially induces Y1150 phosphorylation in the {IR} kinase domain. Moreover, Y1150-biased phosphorylation induced by {IR-A48} selectively activates specific signaling pathways downstream of {IR.} In contrast to insulin-mediated activation of {IR,} {IR-A48} binding has little effect on the {MAPK} pathway and proliferation of cancer cells. Instead, {AKT} S473 phosphorylation is highly stimulated by {IR-A48,} resulting in increased glucose uptake both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present {IR-A48} as a biased agonist able to selectively induce the metabolic activity of {IR} through allosteric binding. Furthermore, our study also suggests that aptamers can be a promising tool for developing artificial biased agonists to targeted receptors.},

We show here that this termination mode and ensuing {CUTs} degradation crucially depend on the position of {RNA} polymerase {II} relative to the transcription start site. Notably, position sensing correlates with the phosphorylation status of the polymerase C-terminal domain {(CTD).} The Nrd1 complex is recruited to chromatin via interactions with both the nascent {RNA} and the {CTD,} but a permissive phosphorylation status of the latter is absolutely required for efficient transcription termination. We discuss the mechanism underlying the regulation of coexisting cryptic and {mRNA-productive} transcription.},

  abstract={Transcriptional regulation requires the binding of transcription factors {(TFs)} to short sequence-specific {DNA} motifs, usually located at the gene regulatory regions. Interestingly, based on a vast amount of data accumulated from genomic assays, it has been shown that only a small fraction of all potential binding sites containing the consensus motif of a given {TF} actually bind the protein. Recent in vitro binding assays, which exclude the effects of the cellular environment, also demonstrate selective {TF} binding. An intriguing conjecture is that the surroundings of cognate binding sites have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other sequences containing a similar motif that are not bound by the {TF.} To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and {DNA} shape features surrounding the core-binding sites of 239 and 56 {TFs} extracted from in vitro {HT-SELEX} binding assays and in vivo {ChIP-seq} data, respectively. Comparing the nucleotide content of the regions around the {TF-bound} sites to the counterpart unbound regions containing the same consensus motifs revealed significant differences that extend far beyond the core-binding site. Specifically, the environment of the bound motifs demonstrated unique sequence compositions, {DNA} shape features, and overall high similarity to the core-binding motif. Notably, the regions around the binding sites of {TFs} that belong to the same {TF} families exhibited similar features, with high agreement between the in vitro and in vivo data sets. We propose that these unique features assist in guiding {TFs} to their cognate binding sites.},

  abstract={A new {DNA} aptamer targeting Protein A is presented. The aptamer was selected by use of the {FluMag-SELEX} procedure. The {SELEX} technology {(Systematic} Evolution of Ligands by {EXponential} enrichment) is widely applied as an in vitro selection and amplification method to generate target-specific aptamers and exists in various modified variants. {FluMag-SELEX} is one of them and is characterized by the use of magnetic beads for target immobilization and fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides for monitoring the aptamer selection progress. Structural investigations and sequence truncation experiments of the selected aptamer for Protein A led to the conclusion, that a stem-loop structure at its 5'-end including the 5'-primer binding site is essential for aptamer-target binding. Extensive interaction analyses between aptamer and Protein A were performed by methods like surface plasmon resonance, {MicroScale} Thermophoresis and bead-based binding assays using fluorescence measurements. The binding of the aptamer to its target was thus investigated in assays with immobilization of one of the binding partners each, and with both binding partners in solution. Affinity constants were determined in the low micromolar to submicromolar range, increasing to the nanomolar range under the assumption of avidity. Protein A provides more than one binding site for the aptamer, which may overlap with the known binding sites for immunoglobulins. The aptamer binds specifically to both native and recombinant Protein A, but not to other immunoglobulin-binding proteins like Protein G and L. Cross specificity to other proteins was not found. The application of the aptamer is directed to Protein A detection or affinity purification. Moreover, whole cells of Staphylococcus aureus, presenting Protein A on the cell surface, could also be bound by the aptamer.},

  abstract={Annotation transfer is a principal process in genome annotation. It involves "transferring" structural and functional annotation to uncharacterized open reading frames {(ORFs)} in a newly completed genome from experimentally characterized proteins similar in sequence. To prevent errors in genome annotation, it is important that this process be robust and statistically well-characterized, especially with regard to how it depends on the degree of sequence similarity. Previously, we and others have analyzed annotation transfer in single-domain proteins. Multi-domain proteins, which make up the bulk of the {ORFs} in eukaryotic genomes, present more complex issues in functional conservation. Here we present a large-scale survey of annotation transfer in these proteins, using scop superfamilies to define domain folds and a thesaurus based on {SWISS-PROT} keywords to define functional categories. Our survey reveals that multi-domain proteins have significantly less functional conservation than single-domain ones, except when they share the exact same combination of domain folds. In particular, we find that for multi-domain proteins, approximate function can be accurately transferred with only 35\% certainty for pairs of proteins sharing one structural superfamily. In contrast, this value is 67\% for pairs of single-domain proteins sharing the same structural superfamily. On the other hand, if two multi-domain proteins contain the same combination of two structural superfamilies the probability of their sharing the same function increases to 80\% in the case of complete coverage along the full length of both proteins, this value increases further to \&gt; 90\%. Moreover, we found that only 70 of the current total of 455 structural superfamilies are found in both single and multi-domain proteins and only 14 of these were associated with the same function in both categories of proteins. We also investigated the degree to which function could be transferred between pairs of multi-domain proteins with respect to the degree of sequence similarity between them, finding that functional divergence at a given amount of sequence similarity is always about two-fold greater for pairs of multi-domain proteins (sharing similarity over a single domain) in comparison to pairs of single-domain ones, though the overall shape of the relationship is quite similar.

  abstract={The yeast {IMD2} gene encodes an enzyme involved in {GTP} synthesis. Its expression is controlled by guanine nucleotides through a set of alternate start sites and an intervening transcriptional terminator. In the off state, transcription results in a short non-coding {RNA} that starts upstream of the gene. Transcription terminates via the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} complex and is degraded by the nuclear exosome. Using a sensitive terminator read-through assay, we identified trans-acting Terminator Override {(TOV)} genes that operate this terminator. Four genes were identified: the {RNA} polymerase {II} phosphatase {SSU72,} the {RNA} polymerase {II} binding protein {PCF11,} the {TRAMP} subunit {TRF4} and the {hnRNP-like,} {NAB3.} The {TOV} phenotype can be explained by the loss of function of these gene products as described in models in which termination and {RNA} degradation are coupled to the phosphorylation state of {RNA} polymerase {II's} repeat domain. The most interesting mutations were those found in {NAB3,} which led to the finding that the removal of merely three carboxy-terminal amino acids compromised Nab3's function. This region of previously unknown function is distant from the protein's well-known {RNA} binding and Nrd1 binding domains. Structural homology modeling suggests this Nab3 'tail' forms an {\&\#x3B1;-helical} multimerization domain that helps assemble it onto an {RNA} substrate.},

The specific contacts we identified are important for binding affinity in vitro as well as for yeast viability. Furthermore, we show that both {RNA-binding} motifs of Nab3 and Nrd1 alone bind their termination elements with a weak affinity. Interestingly, when Nab3 and Nrd1 form a heterodimer, the affinity to {RNA} is significantly increased due to the cooperative binding.

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} transcribes both coding and noncoding genes, and termination of these different classes of transcripts is facilitated by different sets of termination factors. {Pre-mRNAs} are terminated through a process that is coupled to the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, and noncoding {RNAs} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are terminated through a pathway directed by the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and the {RNA} helicase Sen1. We have used an in vivo cross-linking approach to map the binding sites of components of the yeast {non-poly(A)} termination pathway. We show here that Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 bind to a number of noncoding {RNAs} in an unexpected manner. Sen1 shows a preference for {H/ACA} over box {C/D} {snoRNAs.} Nrd1, which binds to {snoRNA} terminators, also binds to the upstream region of some {snoRNA} transcripts and to {snoRNAs} embedded in introns. We present results showing that several {RNAs,} including the telomerase {RNA} {TLC1,} require Nrd1 for proper processing. Binding of Nrd1 to transcripts from {tRNA} genes is another unexpected observation. We also observe {RNA} polymerase {II} binding to transcripts from {RNA} polymerase {III} genes, indicating a possible role for the Nrd1 pathway in surveillance of transcripts synthesized by the wrong polymerase. The binding targets of Nrd1 pathway components change in the absence of glucose, with Nrd1 and Nab3 showing a preference for binding to sites in the mature {snoRNA} and {tRNAs.} This suggests a novel role for Nrd1 and Nab3 in destruction of {ncRNAs} in response to nutrient limitation.},

  abstract={In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nrd1-dependent termination and processing pathways play an important role in surveillance and processing of non-coding ribonucleic acids {(RNAs).} The termination and subsequent processing is dependent on the Nrd1 complex consisting of two {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 and Sen1 helicase. It is established that Nrd1 and Nab3 cooperatively recognize specific termination elements within nascent {RNA,} {GUA[A/G]} and {UCUU[G],} respectively. Interestingly, some transcripts do not require {GUA[A/G]} motif for transcription termination in vivo and binding in vitro, suggesting the existence of alternative Nrd1-binding motifs. Here we studied the structure and {RNA-binding} properties of Nrd1 using nuclear magnetic resonance {(NMR),} fluorescence anisotropy and phenotypic analyses in vivo. We determined the solution structure of a two-domain {RNA-binding} fragment of Nrd1, formed by an {RNA-recognition} motif and helix-loop bundle. {NMR} and fluorescence data show that not only {GUA[A/G]} but also several other G-rich and {AU-rich} motifs are able to bind Nrd1 with affinity in a low micromolar range. The broad substrate specificity is achieved by adaptable interaction surfaces of the {RNA-recognition} motif and helix-loop bundle domains that sandwich the {RNA} substrates. Our findings have implication for the role of Nrd1 in termination and processing of many non-coding {RNAs} arising from bidirectional pervasive transcription.},

  abstract={Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential {(SELEX)} is a revolutionary technology that integrates combinatorial chemistry with high throughput screening to generate from synthesized nucleic acid ligand libraries the high affinity nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) for interesting targets. Recently, the {SELEX} experiments have advanced from targeting the ligand libraries by a single purified target to multiple heterogeneous target samples. Having the potential of bringing enormous technical and economical advantages to drug discovery, the new application suffers from unpredictable performances. To gain an insight of the new method, we develop a computer model to numerically analyze the subtractive {SELEX} alternatively against two distinct heterogeneous samples of unknown targets. The model features the discretization of ligand library, the ligand-target binding equilibrium equations, and the separation efficiency of bound and unbound ligands in experiments. By computer simulations, we investigate how aptamers for desired targets embedded in undefined target mixtures are generated under different experimental conditions. We find the iterative screening scheme is fundamentally capable of developing desired aptamers. On the other hand, target sample configuration and separation efficiency may all together significantly diversify the screening dynamics and results.},

  abstract={{SELEX} (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is an experimental procedure that allows the extraction, from an initially random pool of {DNA,} of those oligomers with high affinity for a given {DNA-binding} protein. We address what is a suitable experimental and computational procedure to infer parameters of transcription {factor-DNA} interaction from {SELEX} experiments. To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription {factor-DNA} interactions to quantitatively model {SELEX.} We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor {CTF/NFI.} From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

  abstract={Nab3 and Nrd1 are yeast heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein {(hnRNP)-like} proteins that heterodimerize and bind {RNA.} Genetic and biochemical evidence reveals that they are integral to the termination of transcription of short non-coding {RNAs} by {RNA} polymerase {II.} Here we define a Nab3 mutation (nab3\&\#x394;134) that removes an essential part of the protein's C terminus but nevertheless can rescue, in trans, the phenotype resulting from a mutation in the {RNA} recognition motif of Nab3. This low complexity region of Nab3 appears intrinsically unstructured and can form a hydrogel in vitro. These data support a model in which multiple {Nrd1-Nab3} heterodimers polymerize onto substrate {RNA} to effect termination, allowing complementation of one mutant Nab3 molecule by another lacking a different function. The self-association property of Nab3 adds to the previously documented interactions between these {hnRNP-like} proteins, {RNA} polymerase {II,} and the nascent transcript, leading to a network of nucleoprotein interactions that define a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex. This was underscored from the synthetic phenotypes of yeast strains with pairwise combinations of Nrd1 and Nab3 mutations known to affect their distinct biochemical activities. The mutations included a Nab3 self-association defect, a {Nab3-Nrd1} heterodimerization defect, a Nrd1-polymerase {II} binding defect, and an {Nab3-RNA} recognition motif mutation. Although no single mutation was lethal, cells with any two mutations were not viable for four such pairings, and a fifth displayed a synthetic growth defect. These data strengthen the idea that a multiplicity of interactions is needed to assemble a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex that coats specific nascent {RNAs} in preparation for termination.},

Transcription termination, the process that marks the end of transcription elongation, is regulated by proteins that interact with the polymerase, nascent transcript, and/or chromatin template. The failure to terminate transcription can cause accumulation of aberrant transcripts and interfere with transcription at downstream genes. Here, we review the mechanism, regulation, and physiological impact of a termination pathway that targets small noncoding transcripts produced by {RNA} polymerase {II.} We emphasize the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} pathway in yeast, in which the process has been extensively studied.

  abstract={Non-coding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)} play critical roles in gene regulation. In eukaryotic cells, {ncRNAs} are processed and/or degraded by the nuclear exosome, a ribonuclease complex containing catalytic subunits Dis3 and Rrp6. The {TRAMP} {(Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4} polyadenylation) complex is a critical exosome cofactor in budding yeast that stimulates the exosome to process/degrade {ncRNAs} and human {TRAMP} components have recently been identified. Importantly, mutations in exosome and exosome cofactor genes cause neurodegenerative disease. How the {TRAMP} complex interacts with other exosome cofactors to orchestrate regulation of the exosome is an open question. To identify novel interactions of the {TRAMP} exosome cofactor, we performed a high copy suppressor screen of a thermosensitive air1/2 {TRAMP} mutant. Here, we report that the Nab3 {RNA-binding} protein of the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} complex is a potent suppressor of {TRAMP} mutants. Unlike Nab3, Nrd1 and Sen1 do not suppress {TRAMP} mutants and Nrd1 binding is not required for Nab3-mediated suppression of {TRAMP} suggesting an independent role for Nab3. Critically, Nab3 decreases {ncRNA} levels in {TRAMP} mutants, Nab3-mediated suppression of air1/2 cells requires the nuclear exosome component, Rrp6, and Nab3 directly binds Rrp6. We extend this analysis to identify a human {RNA} binding protein, {RALY,} which shares identity with Nab3 and can suppress {TRAMP} mutants. These results suggest that Nab3 facilitates {TRAMP} function by recruiting Rrp6 to {ncRNAs} for processing/degradation independent of Nrd1. The data raise the intriguing possibility that Nab3 and Nrd1 can function independently to recruit Rrp6 to {ncRNA} targets, providing combinatorial flexibility in {RNA} processing.},

  abstract={Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment {(SELEX)} is an important technology in combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology of developing high affinity target-binding molecules (aptamers) from highly complex nucleic acid ligand libraries. Schematically, the {SELEX} is a series of iterative rounds of operations where in each operational round ligands are incubated with the target (e.g., a purified protein), and target-binding ligands are extracted and amplified. In the recent development of biological study and drug discovery, by incubating ligand libraries with complex target mixtures (e.g., cell fragments), the {SELEX} experiments have been explored to simultaneously develop aptamers for targets embedded in target mixtures: the complex {SELEX.} While holding the considerable advantages of saving experimental resources, practicing the complex {SELEX} has often accompanied with unstable experimental performances. It is therefore important to understand the behaviors of the new application. In this paper, we develop stochastic computer model, and customized computational algorithm to numerically mimic the complex {SELEX.} We model the ligand selection through the probability of ligand binding to complex targets at the binding equilibrium, and efficiency of separating target-binders for amplification. The customized computational algorithm allows us to simulate real experiments that operate on huge ligand libraries. We evaluate the ligand evolution, and aptamer enrichment of complex {SELEX} under various experimental conditions by stochastic simulations, and theorize the simulated results. We argue that the stochastic effects, which were not previously captured in the studies of complex {SELEX,} may significantly affect the results of experiments.},

We propose a computational approach for designing a starting pool of {RNA} sequences for the selection of {RNA} aptamers for specific analyte binding. Our approach consists of three steps: (i) selection of {RNA} sequences based on their secondary structure, (ii) generating a library of three-dimensional {(3D)} structures of {RNA} molecules and (iii) high-throughput virtual screening of this library to select aptamers with binding affinity to a desired small molecule. We developed a set of criteria that allows one to select a sequence with potential binding affinity from a pool of random sequences and developed a protocol for {RNA} {3D} structure prediction. As verification, we tested the performance of in silico selection on a set of six known aptamer-ligand complexes. The structures of the native sequences for the ligands in the testing set were among the top 5\% of the selected structures. The proposed approach reduces the {RNA} sequences search space by four to five orders of magnitude--significantly accelerating the experimental screening and selection of high-affinity aptamers.},

Here we introduce a hybrid approach-component selection using mutual information {(CSUMI)-that} uses a mutual information-based statistic to reinterpret the results of {PCA} in a biologically meaningful way. We apply {CSUMI} to {RNA-seq} data from {GTEx.} Our hybrid approach enables us to unveil the previously hidden relationship between principal components {(PCs)} and the underlying biological and technical sources of variation across samples. In particular, we look at how tissue type affects {PCs} beyond the first two, allowing us to devise a principled way of choosing which {PCs} to consider when exploring the data. We further apply our method to {RNA-seq} data taken from the brain and show that some of the most biologically informative {PCs} are higher-dimensional {PCs;} for instance, {PC} 5 can differentiate the basal ganglia from other tissues. We also use {CSUMI} to explore how technical artifacts affect the global structure of the data, validating previous results and demonstrating how our method can be viewed as a verification framework for detecting undiscovered biases in emerging technologies. Finally we compare {CSUMI} to two correlation-based approaches, showing ours outperforms both. A python implementation is available online on the {CSUMI} website.},

To test the implication of this structural insight in vivo, we determined the global effect of increased {5fC/5caC} levels on transcription, finding that such {DNA} modifications indeed retarded Pol {II} elongation on gene bodies.

Four constricted rings consisting of conserved interior {\&\#x3B2;-hairpins} from the two single hexamers create a narrow passageway that tightly fits duplex {DNA.} This narrow passageway, reinforced by the offset of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer interface, is flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, {MCM2} and {MCM5.} These unusual features of the twisted and tilted single hexamers suggest a concerted mechanism for the melting of origin {DNA} that requires structural deformation of the intervening {DNA.}},

Here we perform genome-wide {RNA} sequencing and ribosome profiling in heart and liver tissues to investigate strain-specific translational regulation in the spontaneously hypertensive rat {(SHR/Ola).} For the most part, transcriptional variation is equally apparent at the translational level and there is limited evidence of translational buffering. Remarkably, we observe hundreds of strain-specific differences in translation, almost doubling the number of differentially expressed genes. The integration of genetic, transcriptional and translational data sets reveals distinct signatures in {3'UTR} variation, {RNA-binding} protein motifs and {miRNA} expression associated with translational regulation of gene expression. We show that a large number of genes associated with heart and liver traits in human genome-wide association studies are primarily translationally regulated. Capturing interindividual differences in the translated genome will lead to new insights into the genes and regulatory pathways underlying disease phenotypes.},

  abstract={The {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the messenger {RNA} using a {DNA} template. Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the "secondary channel" is the only route for {NTP} to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the "main channel" could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol {II} have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template {DNA} part of the full transcription bubble {(TB)} is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate through the main channel might overlap with the {TB} region, gaining structural information of the full {TB} is critical for a complete understanding of Pol {II} transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol {II} with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics {(MD)} simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on {NTP} entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow {NTP} loading, the percentage of {MD} conformations containing enough space for {NTP} loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on {MD} simulations with {NTP} loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the {NTP} through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the {NTP} and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template {DNA} strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for {NTP} entry during Pol {II} transcription.},

  abstract={Genes from yeast to mammals are frequently subject to non-coding transcription of their antisense strand; however the genome-wide role for antisense transcription remains elusive. As transcription influences chromatin structure, we took a genome-wide approach to assess which chromatin features are associated with nascent antisense transcription, and contrast these with features associated with nascent sense transcription. We describe a distinct chromatin architecture at the promoter and gene body specifically associated with antisense transcription, marked by reduced {H2B} ubiquitination, {H3K36} and {H3K79} trimethylation and increased levels of H3 acetylation, chromatin remodelling enzymes, histone chaperones and histone turnover. The difference in sense transcription between genes with high or low levels of antisense transcription is slight; thus the antisense transcription-associated chromatin state is not simply analogous to a repressed state. Using mutants in which the level of antisense transcription is reduced at {GAL1,} or altered genome-wide, we show that non-coding transcription is associated with high H3 acetylation and H3 levels across the gene, while reducing {H3K36me3.} Set1 is required for these antisense transcription-associated chromatin changes in the gene body. We propose that nascent antisense and sense transcription have fundamentally distinct relationships with chromatin, and that both should be considered canonical features of eukaryotic genes.},

  abstract={Centromeres are the chromosomal regions promoting kinetochore assembly for chromosome segregation. In many eukaryotes, the centromere consists of up to mega base pairs of {DNA.} On such "regional centromeres," kinetochore assembly is mainly defined {by\&\#xA0;epigenetic} regulation [1]. By contrast, a clade of budding yeasts {(Saccharomycetaceae)} has a "point centromere" of 120-200 base pairs of {DNA,} on which kinetochore assembly is defined by the consensus {DNA} sequence [2, 3]. During evolution, budding yeasts acquired point centromeres, which replaced ancestral, regional centromeres [4]. All known point centromeres among different yeast species share common consensus {DNA} elements {(CDEs)} [5, 6], implying that they evolved only once and stayed essentially unchanged throughout evolution. Here, we identify a yeast centromere that challenges this view: that of the budding yeast Naumovozyma castellii is the first unconventional point centromere with unique {CDEs.} The {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} centromere {CDEs} are essential for centromere function but have different {DNA} sequences from {CDEs} in other point centromeres. Gene order analyses around {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} centromeres indicate their unique, and separate, evolutionary origin. Nevertheless, they are still bound by the ortholog of the {CBF3} complex, which recognizes {CDEs} in other point centromeres. The new type of point centromere originated prior to the divergence between {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} and its close relative Naumovozyma dairenensis and disseminated to all {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} chromosomes through extensive genome rearrangement. Thus, contrary to the conventional view, point centromeres can undergo rapid evolutionary changes. These findings give new insights into the evolution of point centromeres.},

To assess the role of cleavage in {PADT,} we developed a {PADT} assay using {HeLa} nuclear extract.

Prior biochemical studies on the Sen1 homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that it can bind and unwind both {DNA} and {RNA,} but the S. pombe protein is not essential and has not been demonstrated to function in transcription. Furthermore, Sen1 from either yeast has not previously been expressed as a recombinant protein, due to its large molecular mass (252 {kDa} in S. cerevisiae). Here, we report the purification and characterization of the {89-kDa} S. cerevisiae Sen1 helicase domain {(Sen1-HD)} produced in Escherichia coli. {Sen1-HD} binds single-stranded {RNA} and {DNA} with similar affinity in the absence of {ATP,} but it binds {RNA} more stably than {DNA} in the presence of {ATP,} apparently due to a slower translocation rate on {RNA.} Translocation occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, as for the S. pombe protein. When purified from E. coli at a moderate salt concentration, {Sen1-HD} was associated with short {RNAs} that are enriched for the trinucleotide repeat {(CAN)4.} We propose that Sen1 binds to {RNAs} and prevents their stable pairing with {DNA,} consistent with in vivo studies by others showing increased R-loop {(RNA/DNA} hybrid) formation when Sen1 activity is impaired by mutations. Our results are consistent with a model in which Sen1 promotes transcription termination by resolving R-loops.},

Despite the fact that a variety of factors or 'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data, commonly used {RNA-seq} normalization methods only correct for sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the data, more recently developed {RNA-seq} normalization can. We focus on one particular method, {RUVSeq} and show that it is able to increase power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of {RUVSeq} normalization that is applicable to a broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.},

In the present work, we show that loss of the Drosophila tcs3 homolog also leads to a severe reduction in size and demonstrate, for the first time in a non-microbe, that Tcs3 is required for {t(6)A} synthesis. In Drosophila and in mammals, {tRNAi} {(Met)} is a limiting factor for cell and animal growth. We report that the {t(6)A-modified} form of {tRNAi} {(Met)} is the actual limiting factor. We show that changing the proportion of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNAi} {(Met),} by expression of an un-modifiable {tRNAi} {(Met)} or changing the levels of Tcs3, regulate target of rapamycin {(TOR)} kinase activity and influences cell and animal growth in vivo. These findings reveal an unprecedented relationship between the translation machinery and {TOR,} where translation efficiency, limited by the availability of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNA,} determines growth potential in eukaryotic cells.},

Two procedures are developed to efficiently find estimates for the parameters of the model that describe these features and for the residues that define the boundaries of each segment neighborhood. The algorithms can accept nearly any model of segment neighborhood, and can be applied with a broad class of best fit functions including least squares and maximum likelihood. The algorithms successively identify the most important features of the sequence. The application of one of these methods to the haemagglutinin protein of influenza virus reveals a possible mechanism for conformational change through the finding of a break in a strong heptad repeat structure.},

  abstract={{RNA} chain elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} is a complex and regulated process which is coordinated with capping, splicing, and polyadenylation of the primary transcript. Numerous elongation factors that enable pol {II} to transcribe faster and/or more efficiently have been purified. {SII} is one such factor. It helps pol {II} bypass specific blocks to elongation that are encountered during transcript elongation. {SII} was first identified biochemically on the basis of its ability to enable pol {II} to synthesize long transcripts. ((1)) Both the high resolution structure of {SII} and the details of its novel mechanism of action have been refined through mutagenesis and sophisticated in vitro assays. {SII} engages transcribing pol {II} and assists it in bypassing blocks to elongation by stimulating a cryptic, nascent {RNA} cleavage activity intrinsic to {RNA} polymerase. The nuclease activity can also result in removal of misincorporated bases from {RNA.} Molecular genetic experiments in yeast suggest that {SII} is generally involved in {mRNA} synthesis in vivo and that it is one type of a growing collection of elongation factors that regulate pol {II.} In vertebrates, a family of related {SII} genes has been identified; some of its members are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The principal challenge now is to understand the isoform-specific functional differences and the biology of regulation exerted by the {SII} family of proteins on target genes, particularly in multicellular organisms.},

  abstract={Cardiac modelling is the area of physiome modelling where the available simulation software is perhaps most mature, and it therefore provides an excellent starting point for considering the software requirements for the wider physiome community. In this paper, we will begin by introducing some of the most advanced existing software packages for simulating cardiac electrical activity. We consider the software development methods used in producing codes of this type, and discuss their use of numerical algorithms, relative computational efficiency, usability, robustness and extensibility. We then go on to describe a class of software development methodologies known as test-driven agile methods and argue that such methods are more suitable for scientific software development than the traditional academic approaches. A case study is a project of our own, Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment, which is a library of computational biology software that began as an experiment in the use of agile programming methods. We present our experiences with a review of our progress thus far, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared with the development methods used in some existing packages. We conclude by considering whether the likely wider needs of the cardiac modelling community are currently being met and suggest that, in order to respond effectively to changing requirements, it is essential that these codes should be more malleable. Such codes will allow for reliable extensions to include both detailed mathematical models--of the heart and other organs--and more efficient numerical techniques that are currently being developed by many research groups worldwide.},

By sequencing the ends of 5' phosphorylated {mRNA} degradation intermediates, we obtain a genome-wide drug-free measurement of ribosome dynamics. We identify general translation termination pauses in both normal and stress conditions. In addition, we describe novel codon-specific ribosomal pausing sites in response to oxidative stress that are dependent on the {RNase} Rny1. Our approach is simple and straightforward and does not require the use of translational inhibitors or in vitro {RNA} footprinting that can alter ribosome protection patterns.},

Notably, as the distance between sense and anti-sense {TSSs} increases, so does the size of the {NDR,} the level of signal-dependent {TF} binding, and gene activation. We further discover a group of anti-sense {TSSs} in macrophages with an enhancer-like chromatin signature.

We report an {RNAP} {III} pre-termination complex that reveals termination mechanisms controlled by sequence-specific elements in the non-template strand. Furthermore, the {TFIIF-like} {RNAP} {III} subunit C37 is required for this function of the non-template strand signal. The results reveal the {RNAP} {III} terminator as an information-rich control element.

Although all {eQTL} studies so far have assayed messenger {RNA} levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in {RNA} sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced {RNA} from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International {HapMap} Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the {HapMap} project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that {eQTLs} near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

To reveal how the chromatin architecture modulates origin selection and activation, we "footprinted" nucleosomes, transcription factors, and replication proteins at multiple points during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Our nucleotide-resolution protein occupancy profiles resolved a precise {ORC-dependent} footprint at 269 origins in G2. A separate class of inefficient origins exhibited protein occupancy only in G1, suggesting that stable {ORC} chromatin association in G2 is a determinant of origin efficiency. G1 nucleosome remodeling concomitant with {pre-RC} assembly expanded the origin nucleosome-free region and enhanced activation efficiency. Finally, the local chromatin environment restricts the loading of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer either upstream of or downstream from the {ARS} consensus sequence {(ACS).}},

  abstract={Cbf1p is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin protein belonging to the basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper {(bHLHzip)} family of {DNA} binding proteins. Cbf1p binds to a conserved element in the 5'-flanking region of methionine biosynthetic genes and to centromere {DNA} element I {(CDEI)} of S.cerevisiae centromeric {DNA.} We have determined the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants of Cbf1p binding to all 16 {CDEI} {DNAs} in gel retardation assays. Binding constants of full-length Cbf1p vary between 1.7 and 3.8 {nM.} However, the dissociation constants of a Cbf1p deletion variant that has been shown to be fully sufficient for Cbf1p function in vivo vary in a range between 3.2 and 12 {nM.} In addition, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed distinct changes in the {3D} structure of the {Cbf1p/CEN} complexes. We also show that the previously reported {DNA} binding stimulation activity of the centromere protein p64 functions on both the Cbf1 full-length protein and a deletion variant containing only the {bHLHzip} domain of Cbf1p. Our results suggest that centromeric {DNA} outside the consensus {CDEI} sequence and interaction of Cbf1p with adjacent centromere proteins contribute to the complex formation between Cbf1p and {CEN} {DNA.}},

  abstract={{DNA} sequences with high affinity for transcription factors occur more frequently in the genome than instances of genes bound or regulated by these factors. It is not clear what factors determine the genome-wide pattern of binding or regulation for a given transcription factor. We used an integrated approach to study how trans influences shape the binding and regulatory landscape of Pho4, a budding yeast transcription factor activated in response to phosphate limitation. We find that nucleosomes significantly restrict Pho4 binding. At nucleosome-depleted sites, competition from another transcription factor, Cbf1, determines Pho4 occupancy, raising the threshold for transcriptional activation in phosphate replete conditions and preventing Pho4 activation of genes outside the phosphate regulon during phosphate starvation. Pho4 binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation-a cooperative interaction between Pho2 and Pho4 specifies genes that are activated. Combining these experimental observations, we are able to globally predict Pho4 binding and its functionality.},

  abstract={A major limitation of chromatin immunoprecipitation lies in the challenge of measuring the immunoprecipitation effectiveness of different proteins and antibodies and the resultant inability to compare the occupancies of different {DNA-binding} proteins. Here we present the implementation of a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in the {RNA} polymerase {III} (pol {III)} system that allowed us to measure the absolute in vivo occupancy of pol {III} and its two transcription factors, {TFIIIC} and {TFIIIB,} on a subset of pol {III} genes. The crucial point of our analysis was devising a method that allows the accurate determination of the immunoprecipitation efficiency for each protein. We achieved this by spiking every immunoprecipitation reaction with the formaldehyde cross-linked in vitro counterparts of {TFIIIB-,} {TFIIIC-,} and pol {III-DNA} complexes, measuring the in vitro occupancies of the corresponding factors on a {DNA} probe and determining probe recovery by quantitative {PCR.} Analysis of nine pol {III-transcribed} genes with diverse sequence characteristics showed a very high occupancy by {TFIIIB} and pol {III} (pol {III} occupancy being generally approximately 70\% of {TFIIIB} occupancy) and a {TFIIIC} occupancy that ranged between approximately 5 and 25\%. Current data suggest that {TFIIIC} is released during transcription in vitro, and it has been proposed that {TFIIIB} suffices for pol {III} recruitment in vivo. Our findings point to the transient nature of the {TFIIIC-DNA} interaction in vivo, with no significant counter-correlation between pol {III} and {TFIIIC} occupancy and instead to a dependence of {TFIIIB-DNA} and {TFIIIC-DNA} complex maintenance in vivo on pol {III} function.},

Defects in the functions of these {RBPs} underlie a broad spectrum of human pathologies. Systematic identification of {RBP} functional targets is among the key biomedical research questions and provides a new direction for drug discovery. The advent of cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (genome-wide {CLIP)} technology has recently enabled the investigation of genome-wide {RBP-RNA} binding at single base-pair resolution. This technology has evolved through the development of three distinct versions: {HITS-CLIP,} {PAR-CLIP} and {iCLIP.} Meanwhile, numerous bioinformatics pipelines for handling the genome-wide {CLIP} data have also been developed. In this review, we discuss the genome-wide {CLIP} technology and focus on bioinformatics analysis. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the scopes, of various bioinformatics tools. To assist readers in choosing optimal procedures for their analysis, we also review experimental design and procedures that affect bioinformatics analyses.},

Tyrosine hydroxylase {(TH)} is the major rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis in response to stress. However, how {TH} is regulated by epinephrine is still unknown. In the present study, we found that epinephrine increased the expression of {TH} in a dose- and time-dependent manner in {PC12} cells, which was inhibited by propranolol {(\&\#x3B2;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor), but not by phenoxybenzamine {(\&\#x3B1;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor). The increase of {TH} was also inhibited by {SQ22536} (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor), {H-89(PKA} inhibitor) and {LY294002} (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor). More importantly, overexpression of Trx-1 significantly enhanced the expression of {TH,} while Trx-1 {siRNA} suppressed {TH} expression induced by epinephrine.

Finally, the pcf11-13 and sen1-1 mutant phenotypes are very similar, as both accumulate {RNA:DNA} hybrids and display Pol {II} pausing downstream from {NRD} terminators.

  abstract={{RNA-Sequencing} {(RNA-Seq)} has been widely adopted for quantifying gene expression changes in comparative transcriptome analysis. For detecting differentially expressed genes, a variety of statistical methods based on the negative binomial {(NB)} distribution have been proposed. These methods differ in the ways they handle the {NB} nuisance parameters (i.e., the dispersion parameters associated with each gene) to save power, such as by using a dispersion model to exploit an apparent relationship between the dispersion parameter and the {NB} mean. Presumably, dispersion models with fewer parameters will result in greater power if the models are correct, but will produce misleading conclusions if not. This paper investigates this power and robustness trade-off by assessing rates of identifying true differential expression using the various methods under realistic assumptions about {NB} dispersion parameters. Our results indicate that the relative performances of the different methods are closely related to the level of dispersion variation unexplained by the dispersion model. We propose a simple statistic to quantify the level of residual dispersion variation from a fitted dispersion model and show that the magnitude of this statistic gives hints about whether and how much we can gain statistical power by a dispersion-modeling approach.},

  abstract={Genes are often transcribed in random bursts followed by long periods of inactivity. Here we employ the light-activatable white collar complex {(WCC)} of Neurospora to study the transcriptional bursting with a population approach. Activation of {WCC} by a light pulse triggers a synchronized wave of transcription from the frequency promoter followed by an extended period {(\&\#x223C;1\&\#x2009;h)} during which the promoter is refractory towards restimulation. When challenged by a second light pulse, the newly activated {WCC} binds to refractory promoters and has the potential to recruit {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II).} However, accumulation of Pol {II} and phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain repeats at serine 5 are impaired. Our results suggest that refractory promoters carry a physical memory of their recent transcription history. Genome-wide analysis of light-induced transcription suggests that refractoriness is rather widespread and a property of promoter architecture.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic cells initiate {DNA} replication from multiple origins, which must be tightly regulated to promote precise genome duplication in every cell cycle. To accomplish this, initiation is partitioned into two temporally discrete steps: a double hexameric minichromosome maintenance {(MCM)} complex is first loaded at replication origins during G1 phase, and then converted to the active {CMG} {(Cdc45-MCM-GINS)} helicase during S phase. Here we describe the reconstitution of budding yeast {DNA} replication initiation with 16 purified replication factors, made from 42 polypeptides. Origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation seen in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase {(CDK)} inhibits {MCM} loading by phosphorylating the origin recognition complex {(ORC)} and promotes {CMG} formation by phosphorylating Sld2 and Sld3. Dbf4-dependent kinase {(DDK)} promotes replication by phosphorylating {MCM,} and can act either before or after {CDK.} These experiments define the minimum complement of proteins, protein kinase substrates and co-factors required for regulated eukaryotic {DNA} replication.},

  abstract={Abstract The increasing availability of {ChIP-seq} data demands for advanced statistical tools to analyze the results of such experiments. The inherent features of high-throughput sequencing output call for a modelling framework that can account for the spatial dependency between neighboring regions of the genome and the temporal dimension that arises from observing the protein binding process at progressing time points; also, multiple biological/technical replicates of the experiment are usually produced and methods to jointly account for them are needed. Furthermore, the antibodies used in the experiment lead to potentially different immunoprecipitation efficiencies, which can affect the capability of distinguishing between the true signal in the data and the background noise. The statistical procedure proposed consist of a discrete mixture model with an underlying latent Markov random field: the novelty of the model is to allow both spatial and temporal dependency to play a role in determining the latent state of genomic regions involved in the protein binding process, while combining all the information of the replicates available instead of treating them separately. It is also possible to take into account the different antibodies used, in order to obtain better insights of the process and exploit all the biological information available.},

To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used {H4S47C-anchored} cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5\% of budding yeast {(Saccharomyces} cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric {histone-DNA} interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)} sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in {MNase} protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of {DNA} contacts around {H4S47} is accompanied by protection of the {DNA} from {MNase.} Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the {RSC} chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions.

  abstract={{DNA} replication origins are necessary for the duplication of genomes. In addition, plasmid-based expression systems require {DNA} replication origins to maintain plasmids efficiently. The yeast autonomously replicating sequence {(ARS)} assay has been a valuable tool in dissecting replication origin structure and function. However, the dearth of information on origins in diverse yeasts limits the availability of efficient replication origin modules to only a handful of species and restricts our understanding of origin function and evolution. To enable rapid study of origins, we have developed a sequencing-based suite of methods for comprehensively mapping and characterizing {ARSs} within a yeast genome. Our approach finely maps genomic inserts capable of supporting plasmid replication and uses massively parallel deep mutational scanning to define molecular determinants of {ARS} function with single-nucleotide resolution. In addition to providing unprecedented detail into origin structure, our data have allowed us to design short, synthetic {DNA} sequences that retain maximal {ARS} function. These methods can be readily applied to understand and modulate {ARS} function in diverse systems.},

  abstract={All chromosomes must be completely replicated prior to cell division, a requirement that demands the activation of a sufficient number of appropriately distributed {DNA} replication origins. Here we investigate how the activity of multiple origins on each chromosome is coordinated to ensure successful replication. We present a stochastic model for whole chromosome replication where the dynamics are based upon the parameters of individual origins. Using this model we demonstrate that mean replication time at any given chromosome position is determined collectively by the parameters of all origins. Combining parameter estimation with extensive simulations we show that there is a range of model parameters consistent with mean replication data, emphasising the need for caution in interpreting such data. In contrast, the replicated-fraction at time points through S phase contains more information than mean replication time data and allowed us to use our model to uniquely estimate many origin parameters. These estimated parameters enable us to make a number of predictions that showed agreement with independent experimental data, confirming that our model has predictive power. In summary, we demonstrate that a stochastic model can recapitulate experimental observations, including those that might be interpreted as deterministic such as ordered origin activation times.},

To investigate the chromosomal determinants that influence the efficiency of initiation of {DNA} replication genome-wide, we made use of a reverse strategy originally used for the isolation of replication initiation mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, replication origins isolated from chromosomes support the autonomous replication of plasmids. These replication origins, whether in the context of a chromosome or a plasmid, will initiate efficiently in wild-type cells but show a dramatically contrasted efficiency of activation in mutants defective in the early steps of replication initiation. Serial passages of a genomic library of autonomously replicating sequences {(ARSs)} in such a mutant allowed us to select for constitutively active {ARSs.} We found a hierarchy of preferential initiation of {ARSs} that correlates with local transcription patterns. This preferential usage is enhanced in mutants defective in the assembly of the prereplication complex {(pre-RC)} but not in mutants defective in the activation of the {pre-RC.} Our findings are consistent with an interference of local transcription with the assembly of the {pre-RC} at a majority of replication origins.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotes initiates at specific sites known as origins of replication, or replicators. These replication origins occur throughout the genome, though the propensity of their occurrence depends on the type of organism. In eukaryotes, zones of initiation of replication spanning from about 100 to 50,000 base pairs have been reported. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where some autonomously replicating sequences, or {ARS} elements, confer origin activity. {ARS} elements are short {DNA} sequences of a few hundred base pairs, identified by their efficiency at initiating a replication event when cloned in a plasmid. {ARS} elements, although structurally diverse, maintain a basic structure composed of three domains, A, B and C. Domain A is comprised of a consensus sequence designated {ACS} {(ARS} consensus sequence), while the B domain has the {DNA} unwinding element and the C domain is important for {DNA-protein} interactions. Although there are {\&\#x223C;400\&\#xA0;ARS} elements in the yeast genome, not all of them are active origins of replication. Different groups within the genus Saccharomyces have {ARS} elements as components of replication origin. The present paper provides a comprehensive review of various aspects of {ARSs,} starting from their structural conservation to sequence thermodynamics. All significant and conserved functional sequence motifs within different types of {ARS} elements have been extensively described. Issues like silencing at {ARSs,} their inherent fragility and factors governing their replication efficiency have also been addressed. Progress in understanding crucial components associated with the replication machinery and timing at these {ARS} elements is discussed in the section entitled {"The} replicon revisited".},

Using these proteins as molecular landmarks for origins, we identified {ORC-} and {MCM-bound} sites throughout the yeast genome. Four hundred twenty-nine sites in the yeast genome were predicted to contain replication origins, and approximately 80\% of the loci identified on chromosome X demonstrated origin function. A substantial fraction of the predicted origins are associated with repetitive {DNA} sequences, including subtelomeric elements {(X} and Y') and transposable element-associated sequences (long terminal repeats).

  abstract={The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of {RNA} biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)} and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (\&lt;1000 bp) {RNAPII} transcripts such as small noncoding {RNAs} {(snRNAs),} cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs),} and some stable unannotated transcripts {(SUTs)} that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 {(NNS)} dependent mechanism. {NNS-dependent} termination is coupled to {RNA} 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of {ncRNA} transcripts including {CUTs.} To determine the role of Rrp6 in {NNS} termination globally, we performed {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} on total {RNA} and perform {ChIP-exo} analysis of {RNA} Polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} localization. Deletion of {RRP6} promotes hyper-elongation of multiple {NNS-dependent} transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' {RNA} ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in {RNAPII} termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in {mRNA} expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known {NNS} targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at {CUTs.} Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the {NNS} complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end {RNA} processing and/or degradation at specific targets.},

  abstract={Widely transcribed compact genomes must cope with the major challenge of frequent overlapping or concurrent transcription events. Efficient and timely transcription termination is crucial to control pervasive transcription and prevent transcriptional interference. In yeast, transcription termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} occurs via two possible pathways that both require recognition of termination signals on nascent {RNA} by specific factors. We describe here an additional mechanism of transcription termination for {RNAPII} and demonstrate its biological significance. We show that the transcriptional activator Reb1p bound to {DNA} is a roadblock for {RNAPII,} which pauses and is ubiquitinated, thus triggering termination. Reb1p-dependent termination generates a class of cryptic transcripts that {are\&\#xA0;degraded} in the nucleus by the exosome. We also observed transcriptional interference between neighboring genes in the absence of Reb1p. This work demonstrates the importance of roadblock termination for controlling pervasive transcription and preventing transcription through gene regulatory regions.},

  abstract={In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix {GeneChip} system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five {MGU74A} mouse {GeneChip} arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 {HG-U95A} human {GeneChip} arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 {HG-U95A} {GeneChip} arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe {(PM} and {MM)} values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference {(AvDiff)} and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index {(MBEI).} The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average {(RMA)} of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA)} model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error {(SE)} to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

A comparison of two accessions, the reference strain Columbia {(Col)} and the strain Landsberg erecta {(Ler),} identified nearly 4000 {SFPs,} which could be reliably scored at a 5\% error rate. Ler sequence was used to confirm 117 of 121 {SFPs} and to determine the sensitivity of array hybridization. Features containing sequence repeats, as well as those from high copy genes, showed greater polymorphism rates. A linear clustering algorithm was developed to identify clusters of {SFPs} representing potential deletions in 111 genes at a 5\% false discovery rate {(FDR).} Among the potential deletions were transposons, disease resistance genes, and genes involved in secondary metabolism. The applicability of this technique was demonstrated by genotyping a recombinant inbred line. Recombination break points could be clearly defined, and in one case delimited to an interval of 29 kb. We further demonstrate that array hybridization can be combined with bulk segregant analysis to quickly map mutations.

  abstract={Biological processes are not exempt from errors and {RNA} production is not an exception to this rule. Errors can arise stochastically or be genetically fixed and systematically appear in the biochemical or cellular phenotype. In any case, quality control mechanisms are essential to minimize the potentially toxic effects of faulty {RNA} production or processing. Although many {RNA} molecules express their functional potential in the cytoplasm, as messengers, adaptors or operators of gene expression pathways, a large share of quality control occurs in the nucleus. This is likely because the early timing of occurrence and the subcellular partition make the control more efficient, at least as long as the defects can be detected ahead of the cytoplasmic phase of the {RNA} life cycle. One crucial point in discussing {RNA} quality control resides in its definition. A stringent take would imply the existence of specific mechanisms to recognize the error and the consequent repair or elimination of the faulty molecule. One example in the {RNA} field could be the recognition of a premature stop codon by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, discussed elsewhere in this issue. A more relaxed view posits that the thermodynamic or kinetic aftermath of a mistake (e.g. a blockage or a delay in processing) by itself constitutes the recognition event, which triggers downstream quality control. Because whether inappropriate molecules are specifically recognized remains unclear in many cases, we will adopt the more relaxed definition of {RNA} quality control. {RNA} repair remains episodic and the degradative elimination of crippled molecules appears to be the rule. Therefore we will briefly describe the actors of {RNA} degradation in the nucleus. Detailed analyses of the mechanism of action of these enzymes can be found in several excellent and recent reviews, including in this issue. Finally, we will restrict our analysis to the yeast model, which is used in the majority of {RNA} quality control studies, but examples exist in the literature indicating that many of the principles of {RNA} quality control described in yeast also apply to other eukaryotes.

A ribozyme situated downstream of the gene restored accurate splicing inhibited by the {CTD} mutant or a mutant {poly(A)} site, suggesting that cleavage liberates {RNA} from a niche that is inaccessible to splicing factors. Although ribozyme cleavage enhanced splicing, 3' end processing was impaired, indicating that an intact {RNA} chain linking the {poly(A)} site to Pol {II} is required for optimal processing. Surprisingly, {poly(A)(-)} beta-globin {mRNA} with a ribozyme-generated 3' end was exported to the cytoplasm. Ribozyme cleavage can therefore substitute for normal 3' end processing in stimulating splicing and {mRNA} export. We propose that {mRNA} biogenesis is coordinated by preventing splicing near the 3' end until the transcript is released by {poly(A)} site cleavage.},

  abstract={We have devised a cis-antisense rescue assay of cleavage and polyadenylation to determine how long it takes the simian virus 40 {(SV40)} early {poly(A)} signal to commit itself to processing in vivo. An inverted copy of the {poly(A)} signal placed immediately downstream of the authentic one inhibited processing by means of sense-antisense duplex formation in the {RNA.} The antisense inhibition was gradually relieved when the inverted signal was moved increasing distances downstream, presumably because cleavage and polyadenylation occur before the polymerase reaches the antisense sequence. Antisense inhibition was unaffected when the inverted signal was moved upstream. Based on the known rate of transcription, we estimate that the cleavage-polyadenylation process takes between 10 and 20 s for the {SV40} early {poly(A)} site to complete in vivo. Relief from inhibition occurred earlier for shorter antisense sequences than for longer ones. This indicates that a brief period of assembly is sufficient for the {poly(A)} signal to shield itself from a short (50- to 70-nucleotide) antisense sequence but that more assembly time is required for the signal to become immune to the longer ones (approximately 200 nucleotides). The simplest explanation for this target size effect is that the assembly process progressively sequesters more and more of the {RNA} surrounding the {poly(A)} signal up to a maximum of about 200 nucleotides, which we infer to be the domain of the mature apparatus. We compared strong and weak {poly(A)} sites. The {SV40} late {poly(A)} site, one of the strongest, assembles several times faster than the weaker {SV40} early or synthetic {poly(A)} site.},

The yeast Ctk1 kinase associates with elongation complexes and phosphorylates serine 2 in the {YSPTSPS} repeats of the Rpb1 C-terminal domain, a modification that couples transcription to {mRNA} 3'-end processing. The higher eukaryotic kinase Cdk9 not only performs a similar function, but also functions at the 5'-end of genes in the transition from initiation to elongation. In strains lacking Ctk1, many basal transcription factors cross-link throughout transcribed regions, apparently remaining associated with {RNApII} until it terminates. Consistent with this observation, preinitiation complexes formed on immobilized templates with transcription extracts lacking Ctk1 leave lower levels of the scaffold complex behind after escape. Taken together, these results suggest that Ctk1 is necessary for the release of {RNApII} from basal transcription factors. Interestingly, this function of Ctk1 is independent of its kinase activity, suggesting a structural function of the protein.},

In this study, mutants of the different termination pathways were compared by genome-wide expression analysis.

  abstract={Proper {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} transcription termination is essential to generate stable transcripts, to prevent interference at downstream loci, and to recycle Pol {II} back to the promoter (1-3). As such, termination is an intricately controlled process that is tightly regulated by a variety of different cis- and trans-acting factors (4, 5). Although many eukaryotic termination factors have been identified to date, the details of the precise molecular mechanisms governing termination remain to be elucidated. We devised an in vitro transcription system to study specific Pol {II} termination. We show for the first time that the exonucleolytic {Rat1\&\#xB7;Rai1} complex can elicit the release of stalled Pol {II} in vitro and can do so in the absence of other factors. We also find that Rtt103, which interacts with the Pol {II} C-terminal domain {(CTD)} and with Rat1, can rescue termination activity of an exonucleolytically deficient Rat1 mutant. In light of our findings, we posit a model whereby functional nucleolytic activity is not the feature of Rat1 that ultimately promotes termination. Degradation of the nascent transcript allows Rat1 to pursue Pol {II} in a guided fashion and arrive at the site of {RNA} exit from Pol {II.} Upon this arrival, however, it is perhaps the specific and direct contact between Rat1 and Pol {II} that transmits the signal to terminate transcription.},

  abstract={We imaged transcription in living cells using a locus-specific reporter system, which allowed precise, single-cell kinetic measurements of promoter binding, initiation and elongation. Photobleaching of fluorescent {RNA} polymerase {II} revealed several kinetically distinct populations of the enzyme interacting with a specific gene. Photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescent {MS2} proteins used to label nascent messenger {RNAs} provided sensitive elongation measurements. A mechanistic kinetic model that fits our data was validated using specific inhibitors. Polymerases elongated at 4.3 kilobases min(-1), much faster than previously documented, and entered a paused state for unexpectedly long times. Transcription onset was inefficient, with only 1\% of polymerase-gene interactions leading to completion of an {mRNA.} Our systems approach, quantifying both polymerase and {mRNA} kinetics on a defined {DNA} template in vivo with high temporal resolution, opens new avenues for studying regulation of transcriptional processes in vivo.},

  abstract={Genes encoding polyadenylated {mRNAs} depend on their {poly(A)} signals for termination of transcription. An unsolved problem is how the {poly(A)} signal triggers the polymerase to terminate. A popular model is that this occurs during extrusion of the {poly(A)} signal, at which time it interacts with factors on the transcription complex. To test this idea we used cis-antisense inhibition in vivo to probe the temporal relationship between {poly(A)} signal extrusion and the commitment of the polymerase to terminate. Our rationale was to inactivate the {poly(A)} signal at increasing times post-extrusion to determine the point beyond which it is no longer required for termination. We found that communication with the polymerase is not temporally restricted to the time of {poly(A)} signal extrusion, but is ongoing and perhaps random. Some polymerases terminate almost immediately. Others have yet to receive their termination instructions from the {poly(A)} signal even 500 bp downstream, as indicated by the ability of an antisense at this distance to block termination. Thus, the {poly(A)} signal can functionally interact with the polymerase at considerable distances down the template. This is consistent with the emerging picture of a processing apparatus that assembles and matures while riding with the polymerase.},

A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major {poly(A)} polymerase Pap1 produces {mRNA} 3' ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated {snoRNAs} in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome. We show that synthesis of independently transcribed {snoRNAs} involves default polyadenylation of two classes of precursors derived from termination at a main {Nrd1/Nab3-dependent} site or a "fail-safe" {mRNA-like} signal. {Poly(A)} tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative {poly(A)} polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the {exosome/Rrp6.} A more important role of {Trf4/TRAMP,} however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with {snoRNA} genes.

  abstract={Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual {RNA} molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger {RNA} stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of {RNA} molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping {RNA} molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding {RNAs} and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70\% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as {RNA} abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes.},

Functional studies demonstrate that these enzymes are part of a novel quality surveillance mechanism for {pre-mRNA} 5'-end capping. Incompletely capped {pre-mRNAs} are produced in yeast and human cells, in contrast to the general belief in the field that capping always proceeds to completion, and incomplete capping leads to defects in splicing and 3'-end cleavage in human cells.

Arrested Pol {II} is reactivated by transcription factor {IIS} {(TFIIS),} which induces {RNA} cleavage that is required for cell viability. Pol {II} arrest and reactivation are involved in transcription through nucleosomes and in promoter-proximal gene regulation. Here we present X-ray structures at {3.3\&\#x2009;\&\#xC5;} resolution of an arrested Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol {II} complex with {DNA} and {RNA,} and of a reactivation intermediate that additionally contains {TFIIS.} In the arrested complex, eight nucleotides of backtracked {RNA} bind a conserved 'backtrack site' in the Pol {II} pore and funnel, trapping the active centre trigger loop and inhibiting {mRNA} elongation. In the reactivation intermediate, {TFIIS} locks the trigger loop away from backtracked {RNA,} displaces {RNA} from the backtrack site, and complements the polymerase active site with a basic and two acidic residues that may catalyse proton transfers during {RNA} cleavage. The active site is demarcated from the backtrack site by a 'gating tyrosine' residue that probably delimits backtracking. These results establish the structural basis of Pol {II} backtracking, arrest and reactivation, and provide a framework for analysing gene regulation during transcription elongation.},

Here, we use the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the global mechanisms of two germline-enriched {cytoPAPs,} {GLD-2} and {GLD-4,} by combining polysome profiling with {RNA} sequencing. Our analyses suggest that {GLD-2} activity mediates {mRNA} stability of many translationally repressed {mRNAs.} This correlates with a general shortening of long {poly(A)} tails in gld-2-compromised animals, suggesting that most if not all targets are stabilized via robust {GLD-2-mediated} polyadenylation. By contrast, only mild polyadenylation defects are found in gld-4-compromised animals and few {mRNAs} change in abundance. Interestingly, we detect a reduced number of polysomes in gld-4 mutants and {GLD-4} protein co-sediments with polysomes, which together suggest that {GLD-4} might stimulate or maintain translation directly.

  abstract={The ribosomal protein genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responsible for nearly 40\% of the polymerase {II} transcription initiation events, are characterized by the constitutive tight binding of the transcription factor Rap1. Rap1 binds at many places in the yeast genome, including glycolytic enzyme genes, the silent {MAT} loci, and telomeres, its specificity arising from specific cofactors recruited at the appropriate genes. At the ribosomal protein genes two such cofactors have recently been identified as Fhl1 and Ifh1. We have now characterized the interaction of these factors at a bidirectional ribosomal protein promoter by replacing the Rap1 sites with {LexA} operator sites. {LexA-Gal4(AD)} drives active transcription at this modified promoter, although not always at the correct initiation site. Tethering Rap1 to the promoter neither drives transcription nor recruits Fhl1 or Ifh1, showing that Rap1 function requires direct {DNA} binding. Tethering Fhl1 also fails to activate transcription, even though it does recruit Ifh1, suggesting that Fhl1 does more than simply provide a platform for Ifh1. Tethering Ifh1 to the promoter leads to low-level transcription, at the correct initiation sites. Remarkably, activation by tethered {LexA-Gal4(AD)} is strongly reduced when {TOR} kinase is inhibited by rapamycin. Thus, {TOR} can act independently of {Fhl1/Ifh1} at ribosomal protein promoters. We also show that, in our strain background, the response of ribosomal protein promoters to {TOR} inhibition is independent of the Ifh1-related protein Crf1, indicating that the role of this corepressor is strain specific. Fine-structure chromatin mapping of several ribosomal protein promoters revealed that histones are essentially absent from the Rap1 sites, while Fhl1 and Ifh1 are coincident with each other but distinct from Rap1.},

  abstract={Coordinate regulation of ribosomal protein {(RP)} genes is key for controlling cell growth. In yeast, it is unclear how this regulation achieves the required equimolar amounts of the different {RP} components, given that some {RP} genes exist in duplicate copies, while others have only one copy. Here, we tested whether the solution to this challenge is partly encoded within the {DNA} sequence of the {RP} promoters, by fusing 110 different {RP} promoters to a fluorescent gene reporter, allowing us to robustly detect differences in their promoter activities that are as small as {\textasciitilde}10\%. We found that single-copy {RP} promoters have significantly higher activities, suggesting that proper {RP} stoichiometry is indeed partly encoded within the {RP} promoters. Notably, we also partially uncovered how this regulation is encoded by finding that {RP} promoters with higher activity have more nucleosome-disfavoring sequences and characteristic spatial organizations of these sequences and of binding sites for key {RP} regulators. Mutations in these elements result in a significant decrease of {RP} promoter activity. Thus, our results suggest that intrinsic {(DNA-dependent)} nucleosome organization may be a key mechanism by which genomes encode biologically meaningful promoter activities. Our approach can readily be applied to uncover how transcriptional programs of other promoters are encoded.},

  abstract={Pervasive and hidden transcription is widespread in eukaryotes, but its global level, the mechanisms from which it originates and its functional significance are unclear. Cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} were recently described as a principal class of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the {Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP} complexes. Although {CUT} degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of {CUTs} are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of {CUTs} in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional {CUTs} and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An {RNA} fraction highly enriched in {CUTs} was analysed by a 3' {Long-SAGE} (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of {CUTs} revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of {CUTs} predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the {CUTs} start upstream from messenger {RNAs} and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new {CUTs} with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified {CUTs} corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels.},

We show here that Ysh1, responsible for cleavage at the {pA} site, is required for efficient removal of Pol {II} from the template. Depletion of Ysh1 from the nucleus does not, however, lead to readthrough transcription. In contrast, depletion of the termination factor Nrd1 leads to widespread runaway elongation of {non-pA} transcripts. Depletion of Sen1 also leads to readthrough at {non-pA} terminators, but in contrast to Nrd1, this readthrough is less processive, or more susceptible to pausing. The data presented here provide delineation of in vivo Pol {II} termination regions and highlight differences in the sequences that signal termination of different classes of {non-pA} transcripts.},

There are several bioinformatics approaches to improve probe assignments, but without in-house programming expertise, standardizing these custom array specifications as a usable file (e.g. as Affymetrix {CDFs)} is difficult, owing mostly to the complexity of the specification file format. However, without correctly standardized files there is a significant barrier for testing competing analysis approaches since this file is one of the required inputs for many commonly used algorithms. The need to test combinations of probe assignments and analysis algorithms led us to develop {ArrayInitiative,} a tool for creating and managing custom array specifications.},

  abstract={The recent appreciation of widespread copy number variation in the genomes of healthy human beings has presented a significant challenge to clinical cytogeneticists who wish to use genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization {(CGH)} assays for clinical diagnostic purposes. Clinical cytogeneticists need to differentiate between copy number variants {(CNVs)} that are likely to be pathogenic and {CNVs} that are less likely to contribute to an affected individual's clinical presentation. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the phenotypic effects of most {CNVs} is minimal, leading to the classification of many {CNVs} as genomic imbalances of unknown clinical significance. This has caused many laboratories to resist the use of higher-resolution genome-wide array {CGH} assays for clinical purposes. Ironically, the accumulation and annotation of such array {CGH} data can lead to the rapid identification of pathogenic {CNVs} and the definition of new genomic syndromes that, in turn, are useful for accurate clinical genetic diagnoses.},

  abstract={The major function of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerase {III} is to transcribe transfer {RNA,} {5S} ribosomal {RNA,} and other small non-protein-coding {RNA} molecules. Assembly of the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex on chromosomal {DNA} requires the sequential binding of transcription factor complexes {TFIIIC} and {TFIIIB.} Recent evidence has suggested that in addition to producing {RNA} transcripts, chromatin-assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes may mediate additional nuclear functions that include chromatin boundary, nucleosome phasing, and general genome organization activities. This study provides evidence of another such "extratranscriptional" activity of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes, which is the ability to block progression of intergenic {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription. We demonstrate that the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex bound to the {tRNA} gene upstream of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {ATG31} gene protects the {ATG31} promoter against readthrough transcriptional interference from the upstream noncoding intergenic {SUT467} transcription unit. This protection is predominately mediated by binding of the {TFIIIB} complex. When {TFIIIB} binding to this {tRNA} gene is weakened, an extended {SUT467-ATG31} readthrough transcript is produced, resulting in compromised {ATG31} translation. Since the {ATG31} gene product is required for autophagy, strains expressing the readthrough transcript exhibit defective autophagy induction and reduced fitness under autophagy-inducing nitrogen starvation conditions. Given the recent discovery of widespread pervasive transcription in all forms of life, protection of neighboring genes from intergenic transcriptional interference may be a key extratranscriptional function of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes and possibly other {DNA} binding proteins.},

  abstract={Genetic regulatory circuits are often regarded as precise machines that accurately determine the level of expression of each protein. Most experimental technologies used to measure gene expression levels are incapable of testing and challenging this notion, as they often measure levels averaged over entire populations of cells. Yet, when expression levels are measured at the single cell level of even genetically identical cells, substantial cell-to-cell variation (or "noise") may be observed. Sometimes different genes in a given genome may display different levels of noise; even the same gene, expressed under different environmental conditions, may display greater cell-to-cell variability in specific conditions and more tight control in other situations. While at first glance noise may seem to be an undesired property of biological networks, it might be beneficial in some cases. For instance, noise will increase functional heterogeneity in a population of microorganisms facing variable, often unpredictable, environmental changes, increasing the probability that some cells may survive the stress. In that respect, we can speculate that the population is implementing a risk distribution strategy, long before genetic heterogeneity could be acquired. Organisms may have evolved to regulate not only the averaged gene expression levels but also the extent of allowed deviations from such an average, setting it at the desired level for every gene under each specific condition. Here we review the evolving understanding of noise, its molecular underpinnings, and its effect on phenotype and fitness--when it can be detrimental, beneficial, or neutral and which regulatory tools eukaryotic cells may use to optimally control it.},

  abstract={Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding {RNAs.} These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, {SUTs)} or are rapidly degraded by the {RNA} surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, {CUTs).} One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of {SUTs} and {CUTs} with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of {SUTs} and {CUTs} can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated {RNAs} or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including {SUTs} and {CUTs} has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both {SUTs} and {CUTs} display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from {NFRs} at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from {NFRs} associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.},

To assess the level of functional redundancy between the paralogous Trf4 and Trf5 proteins and to investigate the role of the Trf4-dependent polyadenylation in vivo, we used {DNA} microarrays to compare gene expression of the wild-type yeast strain of S. cerevisiae with either that of {trf4Delta} or {trf5Delta} mutant strains or the {trf4Delta} mutant expressing the polyadenylation-defective {Trf4(DADA)} protein. We found little overlap between the sets of transcripts with altered expression in the {trf4Delta} or the {trf5Delta} mutants, suggesting that Trf4p and Trf5p target distinct groups of {RNAs} for degradation. Surprisingly, most {RNAs} the expression of which was altered by the trf4 deletion were restored to wild-type levels by overexpression of {TRF4(DADA),} showing that the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p is dispensable in vivo. Apart from previously reported Trf4p and Trf5p target {RNAs,} this analysis along with in vivo cross-linking and {RNA} immunopurification-chip experiments revealed that both the {TRAMP4} and the {TRAMP5} complexes stimulate the degradation of spliced-out introns via a mechanism that is independent of the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p. In addition, we show that disruption of trf4 causes severe shortening of telomeres suggesting that {TRF4} functions in the maintenance of telomere length. Finally, our study demonstrates that {TRF4,} the exosome, and {TRF5} participate in antisense {RNA-mediated} regulation of genes involved in phosphate metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that paralogous {TRAMP} complexes have distinct {RNA} selectivities with functional implications in {RNA} surveillance as well as other {RNA-related} processes.

Highly conserved across species, the family is typically represented by one cytoplasmic enzyme {(XRN1/PACMAN} or {XRN4)} and one or more nuclear enzymes {(XRN2/RAT1} and {XRN3).} Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear {XRNs} have proven to be essential in all organisms tested, and deficiencies can have severe developmental phenotypes, demonstrating that {XRNs} are indispensable in fungi, plants and animals. {XRNs} degrade diverse {RNA} substrates during general {RNA} decay and function in specialized processes integral to {RNA} metabolism, such as nonsense-mediated decay {(NMD),} gene silencing, {rRNA} maturation, and transcription termination. Here, we review current knowledge of {XRNs,} highlighting recent work of high impact and future potential. One example is the breakthrough in our understanding of how {XRN1} processively degrades 5' monophosphorylated {RNA,} revealed by its crystal structure and mutational analysis. The expanding knowledge of {XRN} substrates and interacting partners is outlined and the functions of {XRNs} are interpreted at the organismal level using available mutant phenotypes. Finally, three case studies are discussed in more detail to underscore a few of the most exciting areas of research on {XRN} function: {XRN4} involvement in small {RNA-associated} processes in plants, the roles of {XRN1/PACMAN} in Drosophila development, and the function of human {XRN2} in nuclear transcriptional quality control.

  abstract={The predominant organizational theme by which the transcription machinery and chromatin regulators are positioned within promoter regions or throughout genes in a genome is largely unknown. We mapped the genomic location of diverse representative components of the gene regulatory machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an experimental resolution of \&lt;40 bp. Sequence-specific gene regulators, chromatin regulators, mediator, and {RNA} polymerase {(Pol)} {II} were found primarily near the downstream border from the "-1" nucleosome, which abuts against the approximately 140-bp nucleosome-free promoter region {(NFR).} General transcription factors {TFIIA,} {-B,} {-D,} {-E,} {-F,} {-H} were located near the downstream edge from the {NFR.} The -1 nucleosome dissociated upon Pol {II} recruitment, but not upon recruitment of only {TBP} and {TFIIB.} The position of many sequence-specific regulators in promoter regions correlated with the position of specific remodeling complexes, potentially reflecting functional interactions. Taken together the findings suggest that the combined action of activators and chromatin remodeling complexes remove the -1 nucleosome after the preinitiation complex {(PIC)} has partially assembled, but before or concomitant with Pol {II} recruitment. We find {PIC} assembly, which includes Pol {II} recruitment, to be a significant rate-limiting step during transcription, but that additional gene-specific rate-limiting steps associated with Pol {II} occur after recruitment.},

  abstract={{Pre-mRNA} splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which can assemble on {pre-mRNA} cotranscriptionally. However, whether splicing generally occurs during transcription has not been addressed. Indeed, splicing catalysis is expected to occur posttranscriptionally in yeast, where the shortness of terminal exons should leave insufficient time for splicing. Here, we isolate endogenous S. cerevisiae nascent {RNA} and determine gene-specific splicing efficiencies and transcription profiles, using high-density tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes. Analysis of transcription profiles reveals Pol {II} pausing within the terminal exons of these genes. Intronless and inefficiently spliced genes lack this pause. In silico simulations of transcription and splicing kinetics confirm that this pausing event provides sufficient time for splicing before termination. The discovery of terminal exon pausing demonstrates functional coupling of transcription and splicing near gene ends.},

  abstract={High-throughput sequencing of {cDNA} {(RNA-seq)} is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic {RNAs} with various lengths, and {GC} content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in {RNA-seq} experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and {RNA} input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control {RNAs} to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to {GC} content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to {RNA} termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control {RNAs,} we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in {RNA-seq} experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements projects {(ENCODE} and {modENCODE),} we demonstrate that external {RNA} controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of {RNA-seq} experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification.

  abstract={Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

  abstract={In addition to their annotated transcript, many eukaryotic {mRNA} promoters produce divergent noncoding transcripts. To define determinants of divergent promoter directionality, we used genomic replacement experiments. Sequences within noncoding transcripts specified their degradation pathways, and functional protein-coding transcripts could be produced in the divergent direction. To screen for mutants affecting the ratio of transcription in each direction, a bidirectional fluorescent protein reporter construct was introduced into the yeast nonessential gene deletion collection. We identified chromatin assembly as an important regulator of divergent transcription. Mutations in the {CAF-I} complex caused genome-wide derepression of nascent divergent noncoding transcription. In opposition to the {CAF-I} chromatin assembly pathway, {H3K56} hyperacetylation, together with the nucleosome remodeler {SWI/SNF,} facilitated divergent transcription by promoting rapid nucleosome turnover. We propose that these chromatin-mediated effects control divergent transcription initiation, complementing downstream pathways linked to early termination and degradation of the noncoding {RNAs.}},

  abstract={{RSC} and {SWI/SNF} are related {ATP-dependent} chromatin remodeling machines that move nucleosomes, regulating access to {DNA.} We addressed their roles in nucleosome phasing relative to transcription start sites in yeast. {SWI/SNF} has no effect on phasing at the global level. In contrast, {RSC} depletion results in global nucleosome re-positioning: both upstream and downstream nucleosomal arrays shift toward the nucleosome-depleted region {(NDR),} with no change in spacing, resulting in a narrower and partly filled {NDR.} The global picture of {RSC-depleted} chromatin represents the average of a range of chromatin structures, with most genes showing a shift of the +1 or the -1 nucleosome into the {NDR.} Using {RSC} {ChIP} data reported by others, we show that {RSC} occupancy is highest on the coding regions of heavily transcribed genes, though not at their {NDRs.} We propose that {RSC} has a role in restoring chromatin structure after transcription. Analysis of gene pairs in different orientations demonstrates that phasing patterns reflect competition between phasing signals emanating from neighboring {NDRs.} These signals may be in phase, resulting in constructive interference and a regular array, or out of phase, resulting in destructive interference and fuzzy positioning. We propose a modified barrier model, in which a stable complex located at the {NDR} acts as a bidirectional phasing barrier. In {RSC-depleted} cells, this barrier has a smaller footprint, resulting in narrower {NDRs.} Thus, {RSC} plays a critical role in organizing yeast chromatin.},

Thirty-five elements were sequenced which bound specifically to a {GST-REB1p} fusion protein coupled to {glutathione–Sepharose} under conditions in which more than 99{\textperiodcentered}9\% of the random sequences were not retained. Twenty-two of the elements contained the core sequence {CGGGTRR,} with all but one of the remaining elements containing only one deviation from the core. Of the core sequence, the only residues that were absolutely conserved were the three consecutive G residues. Statistical analysis of a nucleotide-use matrix suggested that the {REB1p} binding site also extends into flanking sequences with the optimal sequence for {REB1p} binding being {GNGCCGGGGTAACNC.} There was a positive correlation between the ability of the sites to bind in vitro and activate transcription in vivo; however, the presence of non-conformants suggests that the binding site may contribute more to transcriptional activation than simply allowing protein binding. Interestingly, one of the {REB1p} binding elements had a {DNAse} 1 footprint appreciably longer than other elements with similar affinity. Analysis of its sequence indicated the potential for a second {REB1p} binding site on the opposite strand. This suggests that two closely positioned low-affinity sites can function together as a highly active site. In addition, database searches with some of the randomly defined {REB1p} binding sites suggest that related elements are commonly found within {‘TATA-less’} promoters.},

The 5'-boundary of the minimal core promoter capable of transcription initiation, however, was found to lie between -38 and -26. The 3'-deletion extending to -2 and -5 still allowed some transcription, suggesting that the positioning of Pol I is directed by upstream sequences. The results of in vitro analysis of linker scanning mutants {(LSMs)} combined with the deletion analysis showed that the promoter consists of three domains: two essential core domains {(I:} -28 to +8 and {II:} -76 to -51) and a transcription modulating upstream domain {(III:} -146 to -91). These results are in general agreement with those obtained in vivo (1). Using a template competition assay we also analyzed these mutant promoters for their ability to form a stable preinitiation complex. We found that the ability of 5'-deletion mutants to sequester an essential factor(s) correlates with their transcriptional activity. In contrast, several 3'-deletions and some {LSMs} in domain I and {II} decrease transcription activity greatly without significantly decreasing competition ability. The results indicate that the stimulatory function of domain {III} is achieved through its interaction with an essential transcription factor(s), although the other domains also participate in this interaction, perhaps directly or through another protein factor.},

  abstract={In the gal-his3 hybrid promoter {his3-GG1,} the yeast upstream activator protein {GCN4} stimulates transcription when bound at the position normally occupied by the {TATA} element. This {TATA-independent} activation by {GCN4} requires two additional elements in the gal enhancer region that are distinct from those involved in normal galactose induction. Both additional elements appear to be functionally distinct from a classical {TATA} element because they cannot be replaced by the {TFIID-binding} sequence {TATAAA.} One of these elements, termed Q, is essential for {GCN4-activated} transcription and contains the sequence {GTCAC} {CCG,} which overlaps (but is distinct from) a {GAL4} binding site. Surprisingly, relatively small increases in the distance between Q and the {GCN4} binding site significantly reduce the level of transcription. The Q element specifically interacts with a yeast protein {(Q-binding} protein {[QBP])} that may be equivalent to Y, a protein that binds at a sequence that forms a constraint to nucleosome positioning. Analysis of various deletion mutants indicates that the sequence requirements for binding by {QBP} in vitro are indistinguishable from those necessary for Q activity in vivo, strongly suggesting that {QBP} is required for the function of this {TATA-independent} promoter. These results support the view that transcriptional activation can occur by an alternative mechanism in which the {TATA-binding} factor {TFIID} either is not required or is not directly bound to {DNA.} In addition, they suggest a potential role of nucleosome positioning for the activity of a promoter.},

  abstract={In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {DGK1-encoded} diacylglycerol kinase catalyzes the {CTP-dependent} phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to form phosphatidate. This enzyme, in conjunction with {PAH1-encoded} phosphatidate phosphatase, controls the levels of phosphatidate and diacylglycerol for phospholipid synthesis, membrane growth, and lipid droplet formation. In this work, we showed that a functional level of diacylglycerol kinase is regulated by the Reb1p transcription factor. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, purified recombinant Reb1p was shown to specifically bind its consensus recognition sequence {(CGGGTAA,} -166 to -160) in the {DGK1} promoter. Analysis of cells expressing the {PDGK1-lacZ} reporter gene showed that mutations {(GT\&\#x2192;TG)} in the Reb1p-binding sequence caused an 8.6-fold reduction in {\&\#x3B2;-galactosidase} activity. The expression of {DGK1(reb1),} a {DGK1} allele containing the Reb1p-binding site mutation, was greatly lower than that of the wild type allele, as indicated by analyses of {DGK1} {mRNA,} Dgk1p, and diacylglycerol kinase activity. In the presence of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis, the dgk1\&\#x394; mutant expressing {DGK1(reb1)} exhibited a significant defect in growth as well as in the synthesis of phospholipids from triacylglycerol mobilization. Unlike {DGK1,} the {DGK1(reb1)} expressed in the dgk1\&\#x394; pah1\&\#x394; mutant did not result in the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, which occurs in cells lacking phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the Reb1p-mediated regulation of diacylglycerol kinase plays a major role in its in vivo functions in lipid metabolism.},

  abstract={Transcriptomic analyses have identified tens of thousands of intergenic, intronic, and cis-antisense long noncoding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} that are expressed from mammalian genomes. Despite progress in functional characterization, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of {lncRNAs} and their half-lives. Although many are easily detectable by a variety of techniques, it has been assumed that {lncRNAs} are generally unstable, but this has not been examined genome-wide. Utilizing a custom noncoding {RNA} array, we determined the half-lives of {\&\#x223C;800} {lncRNAs} and {\&\#x223C;12,000} {mRNAs} in the mouse Neuro-2a cell line. We find only a minority of {lncRNAs} are unstable. {LncRNA} half-lives vary over a wide range, comparable to, although on average less than, that of {mRNAs,} suggestive of complex metabolism and widespread functionality. Combining half-lives with comprehensive {lncRNA} annotations identified hundreds of unstable (half-life \&lt; 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic {lncRNAs,} as well as {lncRNAs} showing extreme stability (half-life \&gt; 16 h). Analysis of {lncRNA} features revealed that intergenic and cis-antisense {RNAs} are more stable than those derived from introns, as are spliced {lncRNAs} compared to unspliced (single exon) transcripts. Subcellular localization of {lncRNAs} indicated widespread trafficking to different cellular locations, with nuclear-localized {lncRNAs} more likely to be unstable.

  abstract={Long noncoding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} are a pervasive and recently recognized class of genes. {lncRNAs} have been proposed to modulate gene expression and nuclear architecture, but their physiological functions are still largely unclear. Several recent efforts to inactivate {lncRNA} genes in mouse models have shed light on their functions. Different genetic strategies have yielded specific lessons about the roles of {lncRNA} transcription, the {lncRNA} transcript itself, and underlying sequence elements. Current results indicate important functions for {lncRNAs} in organ development, immunity, organismal viability, and in human diseases.},

  abstract={The continuing increase in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders such as {type-II} diabetes and an accelerating aging population globally will remain the major contributors to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the 21st century. It is well known that aging is highly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence also shows that obesity and metabolic diseases accelerate aging process. Studies in experimental animal models demonstrate similarity of metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes in metabolic diseases and old age, e.g. insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic low grade inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and heart failure, as well as vascular dysfunctions. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms linking metabolic stress, aging, and ultimately cardiovascular diseases are still elusive. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin {(mTOR)} signalling is a well known regulator of metabolism and lifespan in model organisms, its central role in linking metabolic stress, aging and cardiovascular diseases is recently emerging. In this article, we review the evidence supporting the role of {mTOR} signalling as a molecular interface connecting metabolic stress, aging and cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic potentials of targeting {mTOR} signalling to protect against metabolic and age-associated cardiovascular diseases are discussed.},

However, the ubiquitin ligase {(E3)} responsible for Pol {II} polyubiquitylation has not been identified in humans or the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

  abstract={{DNA} damage triggers polyubiquitylation and degradation of the largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII),} a "mechanism of last resort" employed during transcription stress. In yeast, this process is dependent on Def1 through a previously unresolved mechanism. Here, we report that Def1 becomes activated through ubiquitylation- and proteasome-dependent processing. Def1 processing results in the removal of a domain promoting cytoplasmic localization, resulting in nuclear accumulation of the clipped protein. Nuclear Def1 then binds {RNAPII,} utilizing a ubiquitin-binding domain to recruit the {Elongin-Cullin} E3 ligase complex via a {ubiquitin-homology\&\#xA0;domain} in the Ela1 protein. This facilitates polyubiquitylation of Rpb1, triggering its proteasome-mediated degradation. Together, these results outline the multistep mechanism of Rpb1 polyubiquitylation triggered by transcription stress and uncover the key role played by Def1 as a facilitator of {Elongin-Cullin} ubiquitin ligase function.},

  abstract={Recent experiments provide an unprecedented view of {protein-DNA} binding in yeast and human genomes at single-nucleotide resolution. These measurements, performed over large cell populations, show quite generally that sequence-specific transcription regulators with well-defined {protein-DNA} consensus motifs bind only a fraction among all consensus motifs present in the genome. Alternatively, proteins in vivo often bind {DNA} regions lacking known consensus sequences. The rules determining whether a consensus motif is functional remain incompletely understood. Here we predict that genomic background surrounding specific {protein-DNA} binding motifs statistically modulates the binding of sequence-specific transcription regulators to these motifs. In particular, we show that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding in yeast is statistically enhanced, on average, around functional Reb1 motifs that are bound as compared to nonfunctional Reb1 motifs that are unbound. The landscape of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding around functional {CTCF} motifs in human demonstrates a more complex behavior. In particular, human genomic regions characterized by the highest {CTCF} occupancy, show statistically reduced level of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding. Our findings suggest that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding is fine-tuned around functional binding sites using a variety of design strategies.},

Due to its design, this single reporter exhibits a distinctive signature for many defects in gene expression including transcription, histone modification, {pre-mRNA} splicing, {mRNA} export, nonsense-mediated decay, and {mRNA} degradation. Analysis of the reporter in 4967 nonessential yeast genes revealed striking phenotypic overlaps between chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and {pre-mRNA} splicing. Additionally, we developed a copper-inducible reporter, with which we demonstrate that 5-fluorouracil mimics the {mRNA} decay phenotype of cells lacking the 3'-5' exonuclease Rrp6p. Our reporter is capable of performing high-throughput, rapid, and large-scale screens to identify and characterize genetic and chemical perturbations of the major eukaryotic gene expression processes.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} are thought to be degraded in the nucleus by a process involving polyadenylation and 3'-to-5' degradation by the nuclear exosome. In this work, we examine the degradation pathway of the {RNA} {SRG1,} which is produced from an intergenic region and contributes to the regulation of the {SER3} gene by promoter occlusion during {SRG1} transcription. Although there is some effect on {SRG1} transcript levels when the nuclear exosome is compromised, the bulk of the {SRG1} {RNA} is degraded in the cytoplasm by decapping and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic digestion. Examination of other {CUTs} suggests that individual {CUTs} can be degraded by a variety of different mechanisms, including nuclear decay, cytoplasmic decapping and 5'-to-3' decay, and nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, some {CUTs} appear to be associated with polyribosomes. These results indicate that some {CUTs} can be exported from the nucleus and enter translation before being degraded, identifying a potential mechanism for the evolution of new protein-encoding genes.},

  abstract={{ChIP-seq} has become a major tool for the genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding or histone modification sites. Most peak-calling algorithms require input control datasets to model the occurrence of background reads to account for local sequencing and {GC} bias. However, the {GC-content} of reads in Input-seq datasets deviates significantly from that in {ChIP-seq} datasets. Moreover, we observed that a commonly used peak calling program performed equally well when the use of a simulated uniform background set was compared to an Input-seq dataset. This contradicts the assumption that input control datasets are necessary to fatefully reflect the background read distribution. Because the {GC-content} of the abundant single reads in {ChIP-seq} datasets is similar to those of randomly sampled regions we designed a peak-calling algorithm with a background model based on overlapping single reads. The application, {OccuPeak,} uses the abundant low frequency tags present in each {ChIP-seq} dataset to model the background, thereby avoiding the need for additional datasets. Analysis of the performance of {OccuPeak} showed robust model parameters. Its measure of peak significance, the excess ratio, is only dependent on the tag density of a peak and the global noise levels. Compared to the commonly used peak-calling applications {MACS} and {CisGenome,} {OccuPeak} had the highest sensitivity in an enhancer identification benchmark test, and performed similar in an overlap tests of transcription factor occupation with {DNase} I hypersensitive sites and {H3K27ac} sites. Moreover, peaks called by {OccuPeak} were significantly enriched with cardiac disease-associated {SNPs.} {OccuPeak} runs as a standalone application and does not require extensive tweaking of parameters, making its use straightforward and user friendly.

  abstract={{tRNAs} are encoded by {RNA} polymerase {III-transcribed} genes that reside at seemingly random intervals along the chromosomes of budding yeast. Existing evidence suggests that the genes congregate together at the nucleolus and/or centromeres. In this study, we re-examined spatial and temporal aspects of {tRNA} gene {(tDNA)} expression. We show that {tDNA} transcription fluctuates during cell cycle progression. In M phase, when {tRNA} synthesis peaks, {tDNAs} localize at nuclear pore complexes {(NPCs).} Docking of a {tDNA} requires the {DNA} sequence of the contacted gene, nucleoporins Nup60 and Nup2, and cohesin. Characterization of mutants that block {NPC} localization revealed that docking is a consequence of elevated {tDNA} transcription. {NPC-tDNA} contact falters in the absence of the principal exportin of nascent {tRNA,} Los1, and genetic assays indicate that gating of {tDNAs} at {NPCs} favors cytoplasmic accumulation of functional {tRNA.} Collectively, the data suggest that {tDNAs} associate with {NPCs} to coordinate {RNA} polymerase {III} transcription with the nuclear export of {pre-tRNA.} The M-phase specificity of {NPC} contact reflects a regulatory mechanism that may have evolved, in part, to avoid collisions between {DNA} replication forks and transcribing {RNA} polymerase {III} machinery at {NPCs.}},

Accordingly, four deviations from previously proposed rules for third position wobble pairing in yeast, three {G:U} and one {A:I} codon-anticodon pairings, were found to be required to account for the reading of 61 coding triplets. The gene copy number for individual {tRNA} species, which ranges from one to 16, correlates well with both the frequency of codon occurrence in a sample of 1756 distinct protein coding sequences (r = 0.82) and the previously measured intracellular content of 21 {tRNA} species. A close link between {tRNA} gene redundancy and the overall amino acid composition of yeast proteins was also observed. Regression analysis values for individual protein coding sequences proved to be effective descriptions of the translational selective pressure operating on a particular gene. A significantly stronger co-adaptation between codon choice and {tRNA} gene copy number was observed in highly expressed genes. These observations strongly support the notion that intracellular {tRNA} levels in normally growing yeast cells are mainly determined by gene copy number, which, along with codon choice, is the key parameter acted upon by translational selection.},

  abstract={Budding yeast noncoding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)} are pervasively transcribed during mitosis, and some regulate mitotic protein-coding genes. However, little is known about {ncRNA} expression during meiotic development. Using high-resolution profiling we identified an extensive meiotic {ncRNA} expression program interlaced with the protein-coding transcriptome via sense/antisense transcript pairs, bidirectional promoters, and {ncRNAs} that overlap the regulatory regions of genes. Meiotic unannotated transcripts {(MUTs)} are mitotic targets of the conserved exosome component Rrp6, which itself is degraded after the onset of meiosis when {MUTs} and other {ncRNAs} accumulate in successive waves. Diploid cells lacking Rrp6 fail to initiate premeiotic {DNA} replication normally and cannot undergo efficient meiotic development. The present study demonstrates a unique function for budding yeast Rrp6 in degrading distinct classes of meiotically induced {ncRNAs} during vegetative growth and the onset of meiosis and thus points to a critical role of differential {ncRNA} expression in the execution of a conserved developmental program.},

  abstract={The exosome is a complex involved in the maturation of {rRNA} and {sn-snoRNA,} in the degradation of short-lived noncoding {RNAs,} and in the quality control of {RNAs} produced in mutants. It contains two catalytic subunits, Rrp6p and Dis3p, whose specific functions are not fully understood. We analyzed the transcriptome of combinations of Rrp6p and Dis3p catalytic mutants by high-resolution tiling arrays. We show that Dis3p and Rrp6p have both overlapping and specific roles in degrading distinct classes of substrates. We found that transcripts derived from more than half of intron-containing genes are degraded before splicing. Surprisingly, we also show that the exosome degrades large amounts of {tRNA} precursors despite the absence of processing defects. These results underscore the notion that large amounts of {RNAs} produced in wild-type cells are discarded before entering functional pathways and suggest that kinetic competition with degradation proofreads the efficiency and accuracy of processing.},

  abstract={Non-coding {(nc)RNAs} are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability. Large {ncRNAs} interact with histone modifiers and are involved in cancer development, X-chromosome inactivation and autosomal gene imprinting. However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought, only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory {ncRNAs} are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' {RNA} exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory {ncRNA} family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq),} we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts {(XUTs)} in which 66\% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)-dependent.} The majority of {XUTs} strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, {RNAPII} chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by {DNA} sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of {RNAPII} occupancy over 273 genes with antisense {XUTs.} These genes show an unusual bias for {H3K4me3} marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing {H3K4me3} triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense {XUTs,} supporting a model in which {H3K4me3} antagonizes antisense {ncRNA} repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense {ncRNA-mediated} regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.},

Uracil deprivation activates selection of distal start sites, leading to the production of stable {mRNAs.} We describe the elements that govern degradation of the {CUT} and activation of {mRNA} production by downstream transcription initiation.

  abstract={Non-coding transcripts originating from bidirectional promoters have been reported in a wide range of organisms. In yeast, these divergent transcripts can be subdivided into two classes. Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts {(CUTs)} because they are terminated by the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. This is the same processing pathway used by yeast {snoRNAs.} Whereas {CUTs} are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts {(SUTs)} are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that {SUTs} are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay {(NMD).} Therefore, {SUTs} may be processed similarly to {mRNAs.} Surprisingly, both {CUTs} and {SUTs} were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended {CUTs} and {SUTs} are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding {RNAs} found in higher eukaryotes.},

Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect {DNA} from {GpC} methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible {PHO5} gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the {PHO5} promoter that introduce a {poly(dA:dT)} tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of {PHO5.} By contrast, mutations that altered {AA/TT/AT} periodicity reduced gene expression upon {PHO5} induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for {DNA} antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as "fuzzy" or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

  abstract={{CLIP-seq} is widely used to study genome-wide interactions between {RNA-binding} proteins and {RNAs.} However, there are few tools available to analyze {CLIP-seq} data, thus creating a bottleneck to the implementation of this methodology. Here, we present {PIPE-CLIP,} a Galaxy framework-based comprehensive online pipeline for reliable analysis of data generated by three types of {CLIP-seq} protocol: {HITS-CLIP,} {PAR-CLIP} and {iCLIP.} {PIPE-CLIP} provides both data processing and statistical analysis to determine candidate cross-linking regions, which are comparable to those regions identified from the original studies or using existing computational tools. {PIPE-CLIP} is available at http://pipeclip.qbrc.org/.},

  abstract={To investigate the mechanisms underlying accurate {pre-mRNA} splicing, we developed an in vitro assay sensitive to proofreading of 5' splice site cleavage. We inactivated spliceosomes by disrupting a metal-ligand interaction at the catalytic center and discovered that, when the {DEAH} box {ATPase} Prp16 was disabled, these spliceosomes catalyzed 5' splice site cleavage but at a reduced rate. Although Prp16 does not promote splicing of a genuine substrate until after 5' splice site cleavage, we found that Prp16 can associate with spliceosomes before 5' splice site cleavage, consistent with a role for Prp16 in proofreading 5' splice site cleavage. We established that Prp16-mediated rejection is reversible, necessitating a downstream discard pathway that we found requires the {DEAH} box {ATPase} Prp43, a spliceosome disassembly factor. These data indicate that spliceosomes distinguish slow substrates and that the mechanisms for establishing the fidelity of 5' splice site cleavage and exon ligation share a common {ATP-dependent} framework.},

  abstract={Spliceosome assembly in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recently shown to occur at the site of transcription. However, evidence for cotranscriptional splicing as well as for coupling between transcription and splicing is still lacking. Using modifications of a previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation {(ChIP)} assay, we show that cotranscriptional splicing occurs approximately 1 kb after transcription of the 3' splice site {(3'SS).} This pathway furthermore protects most intron-containing nascent transcripts from the effects of cleavage by an intronic hammerhead ribozyme. This suggests that a high percentage of introns are recognized cotranscriptionally. This observation led us to screen a small deletion library for strains that sensitize a splicing reporter to ribozyme cleavage. Characterization of the Deltamud2 strain indicates that the early splicing factor Mud2p functions with U1 {snRNP} to form a cross-intron bridging complex on nascent {pre-mRNA.} The complex helps protect the transcript from ribozyme-mediated destruction and suggests an intron-definition event early in the spliceosome assembly process. The transcription elongation mutant strains Deltadst1 and Deltapaf1 show different cotranscriptional splicing phenotypes, suggesting that different transcription pathways differentially impact the efficiency of nascent intron definition.},

  abstract={Most genomes, including yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are pervasively transcribed producing numerous non-coding {RNAs,} many of which are unstable and eliminated by nuclear or cytoplasmic surveillance pathways. We previously showed that accumulation of {PHO84} antisense {RNA} {(asRNA),} in cells lacking the nuclear exosome component Rrp6, is paralleled by repression of sense transcription in a process dependent on the Hda1 histone deacetylase {(HDAC)} and the {H3K4} histone methyl transferase Set1. Here we investigate this process genome-wide and measure the whole transcriptome of various histone modification mutants in a \&\#x394;rrp6 strain using tiling arrays. We confirm widespread occurrence of potentially antisense-dependent gene regulation and identify three functionally distinct classes of genes that accumulate {asRNAs} in the absence of Rrp6. These classes differ in whether the genes are silenced by the {asRNA} and whether the silencing is {HDACs} and histone methyl transferase-dependent. Among the distinguishing features of {asRNAs} with regulatory potential, we identify weak early termination by {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1,} extension of the {asRNA} into the open reading frame promoter and dependence of the silencing capacity on Set1 and the {HDACs} Hda1 and Rpd3 particularly at promoters undergoing extensive chromatin remodelling. Finally, depending on the efficiency of {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1} early termination, {asRNA} levels are modulated and their capability of silencing is changed.},

At {MET} genes Cbf1p appears to function in both activator recruitment and chromatin-remodeling. Cbf1p has been implicated in the regulation of other genes, and {CACRTG} motifs are common in potential gene regulatory {DNA.} A recent genome-wide location analysis showed that the majority of intergenic {CACGTG} palindromes are bound by Cbf1p. Here we tested whether all potential Cbf1p binding motifs in the yeast genome are likely to be bound by Cbf1p using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We also tested which of the motifs are actually functional by assaying for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin remodeling. We show that Cbf1p binding and activity is restricted to palindromic {CACGTG} motifs in promoter-proximal regions. Cbf1p does not function through {CACGTG} motifs that occur in promoter-distal locations within coding regions nor where {CACATG} motifs occur alone except at centromeres. Cbf1p can be made to function at promoter-distal {CACGTG} motifs by overexpression, suggesting that the concentration of Cbf1p is normally limiting for binding and is biased to gene regulatory {DNA} by interactions with other factors. We conclude that Cbf1p is required for normal nucleosome positioning wherever the {CACGTG} motif occurs in gene regulatory {DNA.} Cbf1p has been shown to interact with the chromatin-remodeling {ATPase} Isw1p. Here we show that recruitment of Isw1p by Cbf1p is likely to be general but that Isw1p is only partially required for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin structures.},

  abstract={Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, {NET-seq),} based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with {RNA} polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of {NET-seq} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the {Rpd3S} deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

  abstract={It is now experimentally well known that variant sequences of a cis transcription factor binding site motif can contribute to differential regulation of genes. We characterize the relationship between motif variants and gene expression by analyzing expression microarray data and binding site predictions. To accomplish this, we statistically detect motif variants with effects that differ among environments. Such environmental specificity may be due to either affinity differences between variants or, more likely, differential interactions of {TFs} bound to these variants with cofactors, and with differential presence of cofactors across environments. We examine conservation of functional variants across four Saccharomyces species, and find that about a third of transcription factors have target genes that are differentially expressed in a condition-specific manner that is correlated with the nucleotide at variant motif positions. We find good correspondence between our results and some cases in the experimental literature {(Reb1,} Sum1, Mcm1, and Rap1). These results and growing consensus in the literature indicates that motif variants may often be functionally distinct, that this may be observed in genomic data, and that variants play an important role in condition-specific gene regulation.},

Messenger {RNA} transcripts terminate downstream of the coding region in a process that is coupled to cleavage and polyadenylation reactions. Non-coding transcripts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae {snoRNAs} terminate in a process that requires the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1. We report here the transcriptome-wide distribution of these termination factors. These data sets derived from in vivo {protein-RNA} cross-linking provide high-resolution definition of {non-poly(A)} terminators, identify novel genes regulated by attenuation of nascent transcripts close to the promoter, and demonstrate the widespread occurrence of Nrd1-bound 3' antisense transcripts on genes that are poorly expressed.

  abstract={Chromatin organization plays a major role in gene regulation and can affect the function and evolution of new transcriptional programs. However, it can be difficult to decipher the basis of changes in chromatin organization and their functional effect on gene expression. Here, we present a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the relationship between chromatin organization and gene expression, by measuring {mRNA} abundance and nucleosome positions genome-wide in 12 Hemiascomycota yeast species. We found substantial conservation of global and functional chromatin organization in all species, including prominent nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} at gene promoters, and distinct chromatin architecture in growth and stress genes. Chromatin organization has also substantially diverged in both global quantitative features, such as spacing between adjacent nucleosomes, and in functional groups of genes. Expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and trans-acting chromatin modifiers all play important, complementary, and evolvable roles in determining {NFRs.} We identify five mechanisms that couple chromatin organization to evolution of gene regulation and have contributed to the evolution of respiro-fermentation and other key systems, including (1) compensatory evolution of alternative modifiers associated with conserved chromatin organization, (2) a gradual transition from constitutive to trans-regulated {NFRs,} (3) a loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences accompanying changes in chromatin organization and gene expression, (4) re-positioning of motifs from {NFRs} to nucleosome-occluded regions, and (5) the expanded use of {NFRs} by paralogous activator-repressor pairs.

  abstract={A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA-Seq} gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods {(GLMs)} to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA-Seq} applications, including {ChIP-Seq} for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

  abstract={Nucleosomes are barriers to transcription in vitro; however, their effects on {RNA} polymerase in vivo are unknown. Here we describe a simple and general strategy to comprehensively map the positions of elongating and arrested {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} at nucleotide resolution. We find that the entry site of the first (+1) nucleosome is a barrier to {RNAPII} for essentially all genes, including those undergoing regulated pausing farther upstream. In contrast to the +1 nucleosome, gene body nucleosomes are low barriers and cause {RNAPII} stalling both at the entry site and near the dyad axis. The extent of the +1 nucleosome barrier correlates with nucleosome occupancy but anticorrelates with enrichment of histone variant {H2A.Z.} Importantly, depletion of {H2A.Z} from a nucleosome position results in a higher barrier to {RNAPII.} Our results suggest that nucleosomes present significant, context-specific barriers to {RNAPII} in vivo that can be tuned by the incorporation of {H2A.Z.}},

We now show that Myb is required in vivo for the expression of Polo kinase and components of the spindle assembly checkpoint {(SAC).} Surprisingly, the highly conserved {DNA-binding} domain was not essential for assembly of Myb into {MMB/dREAM,} for transcriptional regulation in vivo, or for rescue of Myb-null mutants to adult viability. {E2F2,} {RBF,} and {Mip130/LIN-9} acted in opposition to Myb by repressing the expression of Polo and {SAC} genes in vivo. Remarkably, the absence of both Myb and Mip130, or of both Myb and {E2F2,} caused variegated expression in which high or low levels of Polo were stably inherited through successive cell divisions in imaginal wing discs. Restoration of Myb resulted in a uniformly high level of Polo expression similar to that seen in wild-type tissue, whereas restoration of Mip130 or {E2F2} extinguished Polo expression. Our results demonstrate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by Myb, {Mip130/LIN-9,} and {E2F2-RBF} in vivo, and also provide an explanation for the ability of Mip130-null mutants to rescue the lethality of Myb-null mutants in vivo.},

  abstract={Long non-coding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} are a group of molecules that function in gene regulation in yeast, plants and mammals. The precise mechanisms of action for {lncRNAs,} however, remain largely unclear. The {GAL} gene cluster has been used as a model system to study the function of these molecules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a historical focus on {lncRNA-dependent} repression. Strikingly, in characterizing the role of the {RNA} helicase Dbp2, we discovered that the {GAL} {lncRNAs} could also promote transcriptional activation of the targeted {GAL} protein-coding genes. Interestingly, these {lncRNAs} help determine how quickly the {GAL} genes can be induced in response to galactose, without altering final steady-state transcript levels. This unexpected finding suggests that one role for {lncRNAs} is to promote the timing of gene expression. Herein, we discuss our discoveries in the context of current models of {lncRNA} functions in eukaryotes, with a key emphasis on future challenges for genomic research.},

  abstract={{TFIIS} is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage activity of arrested {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II).} Recent studies revealed that {TFIIS} has also a role in Pol {II} transcription initiation. To improve our understanding of {TFIIS} function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location analysis of this factor. Under normal growth conditions, {TFIIS} was detected on Pol {II-transcribed} genes, and {TFIIS} occupancy was well correlated with that of Pol {II,} indicating that {TFIIS} recruitment is not restricted to {NTP-depleted} cells. Unexpectedly, {TFIIS} was also detected on almost all Pol {III-transcribed} genes. {TFIIS} and Pol {III} occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel class of targets. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in {tRNA} synthesis and showed a reduced Pol {III} occupancy at the restrictive temperature.

  abstract={{RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq)} has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical {RNA-seq} differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, {DESeq} and {edgeR.} Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10 samples) can be \&lt;1 h, with computation time \&lt;1 d using a standard desktop {PC.}},

  abstract={The rate of transcription elongation plays an important role in the timing of expression of full-length transcripts as well as in the regulation of alternative splicing. In this study we coupled Bru-seq technology with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole {1-\&\#x3B2;-D-ribofuranoside} {(DRB)} to estimate the elongation rates of over 2,000 individual genes in human cells. This technique, {BruDRB-seq,} revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid elongation rates showed higher densities of {H3K79me2} and {H4K20me1} histone marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore, high elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity {DNA} sequence and distance from nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included the density of exons, long terminal repeats, {GC} content of the gene and {DNA} methylation density in the bodies of genes. Our results suggest that some static gene features influence transcription elongation rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by epigenetic regulation. The {BruDRB-seq} technique offers new opportunities to interrogate mechanisms of regulation of transcription elongation.},

Considerable progress has been made using Drosophila melanogaster, both in identifying new cell cycle regulators that respond to developmental cues and in defining the impact of extrinsic signals on homologs of mammalian oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In this review, we discuss each cell cycle phase, highlighting differences between archetypal and variant cell cycles employed for specific developmental strategies.

  abstract={Messenger {RNA} splicing is an essential and complex process for the removal of intron sequences. Whereas the composition of the splicing machinery is mostly known, the kinetics of splicing, the catalytic activity of splicing factors and the interdependency of transcription, splicing and {mRNA} 3' end formation are less well understood. We propose a stochastic model of splicing kinetics that explains data obtained from high-resolution kinetic analyses of transcription, splicing and 3' end formation during induction of an intron-containing reporter gene in budding yeast. Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing. Model comparison is used to assess the alternative representations of reactions. Modelling also indicates the functional coupling of transcription and splicing, because both the rate of initiation of transcription and the probability that step one of splicing occurs co-transcriptionally are reduced, when the second step of splicing is abolished in a mutant reporter.},

  abstract={The packaging of eukaryotic {DNA} into chromatin has profound consequences for gene regulation, as well as for other {DNA} transactions such as recombination, replication and repair. Understanding how this packaging is determined is consequently a pressing problem in molecular genetics. {DNA} sequence, chromatin remodelers and transcription factors affect chromatin structure, but the scope of these influences on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy patterns remains uncertain. Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites having a wide range of affinities. These results indicate that {DNA-binding} transcription factors affect chromatin structure, and probably dynamics, throughout the genome to a much greater extent than previously appreciated.},

  abstract={Circular {RNAs} composed of exonic sequence have been described in a small number of genes. Thought to result from splicing errors, circular {RNA} species possess no known function. To delineate the universe of endogenous circular {RNAs,} we performed high-throughput sequencing {(RNA-seq)} of libraries prepared from ribosome-depleted {RNA} with or without digestion with the {RNA} exonuclease, {RNase} R. We identified \&gt;25,000 distinct {RNA} species in human fibroblasts that contained non-colinear exons (a "backsplice") and were reproducibly enriched by exonuclease degradation of linear {RNA.} These {RNAs} were validated as circular {RNA} {(ecircRNA),} rather than linear {RNA,} and were more stable than associated linear {mRNAs} in vivo. In some cases, the abundance of circular molecules exceeded that of associated linear {mRNA} by \&gt;10-fold. By conservative estimate, we identified {ecircRNAs} from 14.4\% of actively transcribed genes in human fibroblasts. Application of this method to murine testis {RNA} identified 69 {ecircRNAs} in precisely orthologous locations to human circular {RNAs.} Of note, paralogous kinases {HIPK2} and {HIPK3} produce abundant {ecircRNA} from their second exon in both humans and mice. Though {HIPK3} circular {RNAs} contain an {AUG} translation start, it and other {ecircRNAs} were not bound to ribosomes. Circular {RNAs} could be degraded by {siRNAs} and, therefore, may act as competing endogenous {RNAs.} Bioinformatic analysis revealed shared features of circularized exons, including long bordering introns that contained complementary {ALU} repeats. These data show that {ecircRNAs} are abundant, stable, conserved and nonrandom products of {RNA} splicing that could be involved in control of gene expression.},

  abstract={In eukaryotic cells, there is evidence for functional coupling between transcription and processing of {pre-mRNAs.} To better understand this coupling, we performed a high-resolution kinetic analysis of transcription and splicing in budding yeast. This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, {RNA} polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced {mRNA} and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.},

  abstract={Intron lariat {RNAs,} created by {pre-mRNA} splicing, are sources of information on gene expression and structure. Although produced equivalently to their corresponding {mRNAs,} the vast majority of intron lariat {RNAs} are rapidly degraded. However, their levels are enhanced in cells deficient for {RNA} debranching enzyme, which catalyzes linearization of these {RNAs,} the rate-limiting step in their degradation. Furthermore, {RNA} lariats are resistant to degradation by the 3' exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase {(PNPase),} providing a means to enrich for lariat {RNAs.} Working with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, our goal was to develop novel combinations of methods to enhance the use of intron lariat {RNAs} as objects of study. Using {RT-PCR} assays developed for detecting and quantifying specific lariat {RNAs,} we demonstrate the resistance of {RNA} lariats to degradation by {PNPase} and their sensitivity to cleavage by {RNA} debranching enzyme. We also employ sequential treatments with these two enzymes to produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs.} We establish the utility of the methods for analyzing {RNA} debranching enzyme variants and in vitro debranching reactions and discuss several possible applications, including measuring relative rates of transcription and combining these methods with non-gene-specific {RNA} sequencing as a novel approach for genome annotation. In summary, enzymatic treatments that produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs,} combined with {RT-PCR} or {RNA} sequencing, can be powerful tools to advance studies on gene expression, alternative splicing, and any process that depends on the {RNA} debranching enzyme.},

  abstract={Splicing is the removal of intron sequences from {pre-mRNA} by the spliceosome. Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that {pre-mRNA} can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally). Co-transcriptional splicing does not assume that transcription and splicing machineries are mechanistically coupled, yet it raises this possibility. Early studies were based on a limited number of genes, which were often chosen because of their experimental accessibility. Since 2010, eight studies have used global datasets as counting tools, in order to quantify co-transcriptional intron removal. The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Here, we discuss the nature of the various global datasets and how bioinformatic analyses were conducted. Considering the broad differences in experimental approach and analysis, the level of agreement on the prevalence of co-transcriptional splicing is remarkable.},

In eukaryotes, {tRNA} biosynthesis employs a specialized {RNA} polymerase that generates initial transcripts that must be subsequently altered via a multitude of post-transcriptional steps before the {tRNAs} beome mature molecules that function in protein synthesis. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into {tRNA} turnover and {tRNA} subcellular dynamics. {tRNA} processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of {CCA} to the 3' mature sequence and, for {tRNA(His),} addition of a 5' G. About 20\% of yeast {tRNAs} are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to {tRNA} splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating {tRNAs} in which {\&\#x223C;15\%} of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including {tRNA} discrimination, translation fidelity, and {tRNA} quality control. Mature {tRNAs} are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded {tRNAs.} Mature {tRNAs} are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain.},

  abstract={Because {DNA} packaging in nucleosomes modulates its accessibility to transcription factors {(TFs),} unraveling the causal determinants of nucleosome positioning is of great importance to understanding gene regulation. Although there is evidence that intrinsic sequence specificity contributes to nucleosome positioning, the extent to which other factors contribute to nucleosome positioning is currently highly debated. Here we obtained both in vivo and in vitro reference maps of positions that are either consistently covered or free of nucleosomes across multiple experimental data-sets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then systematically quantified the contribution of {TF} binding to nucleosome positioning using a rigorous statistical mechanics model in which {TFs} compete with nucleosomes for binding {DNA.} Our results reconcile previous seemingly conflicting results on the determinants of nucleosome positioning and provide a quantitative explanation for the difference between in vivo and in vitro positioning. On a genome-wide scale, nucleosome positioning is dominated by the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies, and their positioning is mainly determined by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which likely have a much more significant impact on gene expression, are determined mainly by {TF} binding. Interestingly, of the 158 yeast {TFs} included in our modeling, we find that only 10-20 significantly contribute to inducing nucleosome-free regions, and these {TFs} are highly enriched for having direct interactions with chromatin remodelers. Together our results imply that nucleosome free regions in yeast promoters results from the binding of a specific class of {TFs} that recruit chromatin remodelers.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic genomes generate a heterogeneous ensemble of {mRNAs} and long noncoding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs).} {LncRNAs} and {mRNAs} are both transcribed by Pol {II} and acquire 5' caps and {poly(A)} tails, but only {mRNAs} are translated into proteins. To address how these classes are distinguished, we identified the transcriptome-wide targets of 13 {RNA} processing, export, and turnover factors in budding yeast. Comparing the maturation pathways of {mRNAs} and {lncRNAs} revealed that transcript fate is largely determined during 3' end formation. Most {lncRNAs} are targeted for nuclear {RNA} surveillance, but a subset with 3' cleavage and polyadenylation features resembling the {mRNA} consensus can be exported to the cytoplasm. The Hrp1 and Nab2 proteins act at this decision point, with dual roles in {mRNA} cleavage/polyadenylation and {lncRNA} surveillance. Our data also reveal the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of {mRNA} maturation, and highlight a subset of {"lncRNA-like"} {mRNAs} regulated by the nuclear surveillance machinery.},

  abstract={{Microarray-CGH} experiments are used to detect and map chromosomal imbalances, by hybridizing targets of genomic {DNA} from a test and a reference sample to sequences immobilized on a slide. These probes are genomic {DNA} sequences {(BACs)} that are mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can be handled by specific statistical tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this purpose. A {CGH} profile can be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions in the genome whose {BACs} share the same relative copy number on average. We model a {CGH} profile by a random Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt changes at unknown coordinates. Two major problems arise: to determine which parameters are affected by the abrupt changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection of the number of segments in the profile.},

  abstract={There is abundant transcription from eukaryotic genomes unaccounted for by protein coding genes. A high-resolution genome-wide survey of transcription in a well annotated genome will help relate transcriptional complexity to function. By quantifying {RNA} expression on both strands of the complete genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a high-density oligonucleotide tiling array, this study identifies the boundary, structure, and level of coding and noncoding transcripts. A total of 85\% of the genome is expressed in rich media. Apart from expected transcripts, we found operon-like transcripts, transcripts from neighboring genes not separated by intergenic regions, and genes with complex transcriptional architecture where different parts of the same gene are expressed at different levels. We mapped the positions of 3' and 5' {UTRs} of coding genes and identified hundreds of {RNA} transcripts distinct from annotated genes. These nonannotated transcripts, on average, have lower sequence conservation and lower rates of deletion phenotype than protein coding genes. Many other transcripts overlap known genes in antisense orientation, and for these pairs global correlations were discovered: {UTR} lengths correlated with gene function, localization, and requirements for regulation; antisense transcripts overlapped 3' {UTRs} more than 5' {UTRs;} {UTRs} with overlapping antisense tended to be longer; and the presence of antisense associated with gene function. These findings may suggest a regulatory role of antisense transcription in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the data show that even this well studied genome has transcriptional complexity far beyond current annotation.},
