  abstract={{DNAs} that contain specific yeast chromosomal sequences called {ARSs} transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae at high frequency and can replicate extrachromosomally as plasmids when introduced into S. cerevisiae by transformation. To determine the boundaries of the minimal sequences required for autonomous replication in S. cerevisiae, we have carried out in vitro mutagenesis of the first chromosomal {ARS} described, {ARS1.} Rather than identifying a distinct and continuous segment that mediates the {ARS+} phenotype, we find three different functional domains within {ARS1.} We define domain A as the 11-base-pair (bp) sequence that is also found at most other {ARS} regions. It is necessary but not sufficient for high-frequency transformation. Domain B, which cannot mediate high-frequency transformation, or replicate by itself, is required for efficient, stable replication of plasmids containing domain A. Domain B, as we define it, is continuous with domain A in {ARS1,} but insertions of 4 bp between the two do not affect replication. The extent of domain B has an upper limit of 109 bp and a lower limit of 46 bp in size. There is no obvious sequence homology between domain B of {ARS1} and any other {ARS} sequence. Finally, domain C is defined on the basis of our deletions as at least 200 bp flanking domain A on the opposite side from domain B and is also required for the stability of domain A in S. cerevisiae. The effect of deletions of domain C can be observed only in the absence of domain B, at least by the assays used in the current study, and the significance of this finding is discussed.},

The extension of the transcription complex into this {DNA} segment does suggest two possible explanations for highly diverse effects of flanking-sequence substitutions on {tRNA} gene transcription: either (i) proteins that are capable of binding to these upstream {DNA} segments are also potentially capable of stimulating or interfering with the incorporation of {TFIIIB} into transcription complexes or (ii) 5'-flanking sequence influences the rate of assembly of {TFIIIB} into stable transcription complexes.},

  abstract={The transcription of ribosomal {RNA} genes differs from that of other genes in several respects: the use of a specialized polymerase, the generally high level of transcription, and the tandem arrangement of the genes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a nucleotide sequence in the "nontranscribed" spacer region that had many characteristics of an enhancer of transcription (8). More recently, it has become apparent that transcription of this sequence occurs (9) and that it may also be involved in some aspect of termination of 35 S {rRNA} transcription. The likelihood that there are protein factors involved in termination and activation of transcription and that these may participate in the coupling of the transcription of adjacent {rRNA} genes led us to search for proteins that might bind to the enhancer. We have identified two such proteins, termed {REB1} and {REB2,} that bind to the enhancer and protect specific sequences from attack by chemical and enzymatic reagents. It is noteworthy that there is a second {REB1} binding site approximately 210 base pairs upstream of the origin of transcription of {rRNA} and that binding of {REB1} to this site alters the conformation of {DNA} adjacent to the site of initiation.},

This protein, called {CPF1} for centromere promoter factor, binds {DNA} as a dimer. Inactivation of the gene is not lethal but leads to a partial loss of the centromere function and to a Met- phenotype. Changes of the chromatin structure due to inactivation of {CPF1} are seen at centromeres and at several {CDEI-carrying} promoters (e.g. {MET25,} {TRP1,} {GAL2).} However promoter activities are affected in diverse ways making it presently difficult to describe a function for {CPF1} in gene expression. The sequence of the cloned gene reveals in the carboxy-terminal part two potential amphipathic helices preceded by a positively charged stretch of amino acids very similar to the helix-loop-helix domains recently identified in factors controlling tissue specific transcription in higher eukaryotes. Carboxy-terminal truncations of {CPF1} lacking this domain no longer bind to {CDEI.} The amino-terminal half of {CPF1} carries two clusters of negatively charged amino acid residues.

This {TATA-independent} activation by {GCN4} requires two additional elements in the gal enhancer region that are distinct from those involved in normal galactose induction. Both additional elements appear to be functionally distinct from a classical {TATA} element because they cannot be replaced by the {TFIID-binding} sequence {TATAAA.} One of these elements, termed Q, is essential for {GCN4-activated} transcription and contains the sequence {GTCAC} {CCG,} which overlaps (but is distinct from) a {GAL4} binding site. Surprisingly, relatively small increases in the distance between Q and the {GCN4} binding site significantly reduce the level of transcription. The Q element specifically interacts with a yeast protein {(Q-binding} protein {[QBP])} that may be equivalent to Y, a protein that binds at a sequence that forms a constraint to nucleosome positioning. Analysis of various deletion mutants indicates that the sequence requirements for binding by {QBP} in vitro are indistinguishable from those necessary for Q activity in vivo, strongly suggesting that {QBP} is required for the function of this {TATA-independent} promoter. These results support the view that transcriptional activation can occur by an alternative mechanism in which the {TATA-binding} factor {TFIID} either is not required or is not directly bound to {DNA.} In addition, they suggest a potential role of nucleosome positioning for the activity of a promoter.},

The 5'-boundary of the minimal core promoter capable of transcription initiation, however, was found to lie between -38 and -26. The 3'-deletion extending to -2 and -5 still allowed some transcription, suggesting that the positioning of Pol I is directed by upstream sequences. The results of in vitro analysis of linker scanning mutants {(LSMs)} combined with the deletion analysis showed that the promoter consists of three domains: two essential core domains {(I:} -28 to +8 and {II:} -76 to -51) and a transcription modulating upstream domain {(III:} -146 to -91). These results are in general agreement with those obtained in vivo (1). Using a template competition assay we also analyzed these mutant promoters for their ability to form a stable preinitiation complex. We found that the ability of 5'-deletion mutants to sequester an essential factor(s) correlates with their transcriptional activity. In contrast, several 3'-deletions and some {LSMs} in domain I and {II} decrease transcription activity greatly without significantly decreasing competition ability. The results indicate that the stimulatory function of domain {III} is achieved through its interaction with an essential transcription factor(s), although the other domains also participate in this interaction, perhaps directly or through another protein factor.},

  abstract={{RAP1} is a sequence-specific {DNA-binding} protein essential for cell growth. The occurrence of {RAP1-binding} sites in many promoter regions, the mating-type gene silencer elements, and telomeres suggests that {RAP1} has multiple functions in the cell. To assess its role in transcription, temperature-sensitive mutations in {RAP1} were generated. Analysis of rap1ts strains provides evidence that {RAP1} functions in both transcriptional activation and silencing of mating-type genes. Several observations indicate that rap1ts strains are defective in the expression of {MAT} alpha, whose upstream activation sequence {(UAS)} contains a {RAP1-binding} site. At nonpermissive temperatures, decreases in {MAT} alpha steady-state transcript levels can be detected in {MAT} alpha rap1ts strains. Furthermore, these strains are deficient in alpha-pheromone production and simultaneously express at least two alpha-specific genes. These phenotypes can be reversed by replacing the {RAP1-binding} site at {MAT} alpha with a binding site for the {GAL4} transcriptional activator. Certain rap1ts alleles have an opposite effect on the silent mating-type locus {HMR,} which becomes partially derepressed at nonpermissive temperatures.},

  abstract={An amino acid limitation in bacteria elicits a global response, called stringent control, that leads to reduced synthesis of {rRNA} and ribosomal proteins and increased expression of amino acid biosynthetic operons. We have used the antimetabolite 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to cause histidine limitation as a means to elicit the stringent response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fusions of the yeast ribosomal protein genes {RPL16A,} {CRY1,} {RPS16A,} and {RPL25} with the Escherichia coli {lacZ} gene were used to show that the expression of these genes is reduced by a factor of 2 to 5 during histidine-limited exponential growth and that this regulation occurs at the level of transcription. Stringent regulation of the four yeast ribosomal protein genes was shown to be associated with a nucleotide sequence, known as the {UASrpg} (upstream activating sequence for ribosomal protein genes), that binds the transcriptional regulatory protein {RAP1.} The {RAP1} binding sites also appeared to mediate the greater ribosomal protein gene expression observed in cells growing exponentially than in cells in stationary phase. Although expression of the ribosomal protein genes was reduced in response to histidine limitation, the level of {RAP1} {DNA-binding} activity in cell extracts was unaffected. Yeast strains bearing a mutation in any one of the genes {GCN1} to {GCN4} are defective in derepression of amino acid biosynthetic genes in 10 different pathways under conditions of histidine limitation. These Gcn- mutants showed wild-type regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression, which suggests that separate regulatory pathways exist in S. cerevisiae for the derepression of amino acid biosynthetic genes and the repression of ribosomal protein genes in response to amino acid starvation.},

The importance of {DNA} far upstream from the initiation site was confirmed by showing that minigene expression was much reduced by linker scanner mutations clustered around -148 bp, -133 bp and -100 bp, and was abolished by mutations clustered around -118 bp. The enhancer for {rRNA} biosynthesis increased transcription from all of the five mutated promoters that were tested. The magnitude of the enhancer effects on weakly active promoters was two- to three-fold less than on the wild-type promoter.

The second seems to be a novel protein that generates extensive protection over the essential {ARS} consensus sequence and phased {DNaseI-sensitive} sites across a functionally important flanking sequence. Hypersensitivity of this region to cleavage by copper phenanthroline indicates that it is under torsional strain, analogous to that produced at transcriptional start sites by assembly of an initiation complex.

  abstract={The {REB1} gene encodes a {DNA-binding} protein {(Reb1p)} that is essential for growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Reb1p binds to sites within transcriptional control regions of genes transcribed by either {RNA} polymerase I or {RNA} polymerase {II.} The sequence of {REB1} predicts a protein of 809 amino acids. To define the {DNA-binding} domain of Reb1p, a series of 5' and 3' deletions within the coding region was constructed in a bacterial expression vector. Analysis of the truncated Reb1p proteins revealed that nearly 400 amino acids of the C-terminal portion of the protein are required for maximal {DNA-binding} activity. To further define the important structural features of Reb1p, the {REB1} homolog from a related yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis, was cloned by genetic complementation. The K. lactis {REB1} gene supports active growth of an S. cerevisiae strain whose {REB1} gene has been deleted. The Reb1p proteins of the two organisms generate almost identical footprints on {DNA,} yet the K. lactis {REB1} gene encodes a polypeptide of only 595 amino acids. Comparison of the two Reb1p sequences revealed that within the region necessary for the binding of Reb1p to {DNA} were two long regions of nearly perfect identity, separated in the S. cerevisiae Reb1p by nearly 150 amino acids but in the K. lactis Reb1p by only 40 amino acids. The first includes a 105-amino-acid region related to the {DNA-binding} domain of the myb oncoprotein; the second bears a faint resemblance to myb. The hypothesis that the {DNA-binding} domain of Reb1p is formed from these two conserved regions was confirmed by deletion of as many as 90 amino acids between them, with little effect on the {DNA-binding} ability of the resultant protein. We suggest that the {DNA-binding} domain of Reb1p is made up of two myb-like regions that, unlike myb itself, are separated by as many as 150 amino acids. Since Reb1p protects only 15 to 20 nucleotides in a chemical or enzymatic footprint assay, the protein must fold such that the two components of the binding site are adjacent.},

Under reaction conditions optimized for {TBP-DNA} complex formation, the presence of {TFIIB} increased affinity of {TBP} for the {TATA} box by 2.5-fold, while {TFIIA} had no effect. When {TBP} binding conditions were sub-optimal, both {TFIIB} and {TFIIA} independently increased {TBP} affinity by approximately 10-fold. Therefore both {TFIIB} and {TFIIA} have the intrinsic ability to directly increase the affinity of {TBP} for the {TATA} box.

We show that the minimal length of the Cpf1 binding site needed for full in vitro binding and in vivo activity is 10 base pairs long comprised of {CDEI} plus the two base pairs 3' of this sequence. The palindromic core sequence {CACGTG} is most important for in vivo {CEN} function and in vitro Cpf1 binding. Symmetrical mutations in either halfsite of the core sequence affect in vitro Cpf1 binding and in vivo mitotic centromere function asymmetrically albeit to a different extent. Enlarging the {CDEI} palindrome to 12 or 20 bps increases in vitro Cpf1 binding but results in increased chromosome loss rates suggesting a need for asymmetrical Cpf1 binding sequences. Additionally, the ability of Cpf1 protein to bind a mutant {CDEI} element in vitro does not parallel the ability of that mutant to confer in vivo {CEN} activity. Our data indicate that the in vitro binding characteristics of Cpf1 to {CDEI} only partly overlap with their corresponding activity within the centromere complex, thus suggesting that in the in vivo situation the {CDEI/Cpf1} complex might undergo interactions with other centromere {DNA/protein} complexes.},

Thirty-five elements were sequenced which bound specifically to a {GST-REB1p} fusion protein coupled to {glutathione–Sepharose} under conditions in which more than 99{\textperiodcentered}9\% of the random sequences were not retained. Twenty-two of the elements contained the core sequence {CGGGTRR,} with all but one of the remaining elements containing only one deviation from the core. Of the core sequence, the only residues that were absolutely conserved were the three consecutive G residues. Statistical analysis of a nucleotide-use matrix suggested that the {REB1p} binding site also extends into flanking sequences with the optimal sequence for {REB1p} binding being {GNGCCGGGGTAACNC.} There was a positive correlation between the ability of the sites to bind in vitro and activate transcription in vivo; however, the presence of non-conformants suggests that the binding site may contribute more to transcriptional activation than simply allowing protein binding. Interestingly, one of the {REB1p} binding elements had a {DNAse} 1 footprint appreciably longer than other elements with similar affinity. Analysis of its sequence indicated the potential for a second {REB1p} binding site on the opposite strand. This suggests that two closely positioned low-affinity sites can function together as a highly active site. In addition, database searches with some of the randomly defined {REB1p} binding sites suggest that related elements are commonly found within {‘TATA-less’} promoters.},

  abstract={Characterization of the proteins that interact with replication origins, as well as characterization of the mechanisms by which the levels and activities of these proteins are regulated during the cell cycle, is required to understand the initiation of chromosomal {DNA} replication in eukaryotic cells. We have previously shown that the first detectable step in the assembly of initiation complexes in vivo involves the binding of the multisubunit origin recognition complex {(ORC)} and the general transcription/replication factor {ABF1} protein to origins. In this paper we show that {ORC} is present in cells at low levels, corresponding to little more than one complete complex per replication origin, indicating that in vivo origin recognition by {ORC} is extremely efficient. We show that this efficient recognition requires two sequence elements, the essential A element containing the {ARS} consensus sequence and the functionally important B1 element, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we show that origin binding by {ORC} in vivo does not require any other functional sequence element, indicating that it occurs independently of the binding of other factors, such as {ABF1.} Our results suggest a model for the roles of the individual elements of yeast replication origins.},

  abstract={The rate of {RNA} elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} is affected by {DNA} sequences called intrinsic arrest sites. Efficient transcription through these sites requires elongation factor {SII.} In addition to the sequence-specific features of the {DNA,} we show that the acquisition of {SII-dependence} is a function of its "dwell-time" at an arrest site. This temperature-dependent decay in elongation potential appears irreversible, implying that factor-dependent and factor-independent elongation complexes are not mutually interconvertible at this position. {TFIIF} and {NH4Cl} are known to increase the elongation rate of pol {II.} Both agents preempt arrest, consistent with the idea that elongation dwell time influences the process. {TFIIF} and {SII} act upon different steps in a complementary way to prevent or resolve arrest, respectively. They are probably instrumental in facilitating the efficient transcription of large eukaryotic genes in vivo.},

  abstract={Three abundant ubiquitous {DNA-binding} protein factors appear to play a major role in the control of ribosome biosynthesis in yeast. Two of these factors mediate the regulation of transcription of ribosomal protein genes (rp-genes) in yeasts. Most yeast rp-genes are under transcriptional control of Rap1p (repressor-activator protein), while a small subset of rp-genes is activated through Abf1p {(ARS} binding factor). The third protein, designated Reb1p {(rRNA} enhancer binding protein), which binds strongly to two sites located upstream of the enhancer and the promoter of the {rRNA} operon, respectively, appears to play a crucial role in the efficient transcription of the chromosomal {rDNA.} All three proteins, however, have many target sites on the yeast genome, in particular, in the upstream regions of several Pol {II} transcribed genes, suggesting that they play a much more general role than solely in the regulation of ribosome biosynthesis. Furthermore, some evidence has been obtained suggesting that these factors influence the chromatin structure and creat a nucleosome-free region surrounding their binding sites. Recent studies indicate that the proteins can functionally replace each other in various cases and that they act synergistically with adjacent additional {DNA} sequences. These data suggest that Abf1p, Rap1p, and Reb1p are primary {DNA-binding} proteins that serve to render adjacent cis-acting elements accessible to specific trans-acting factors.},

  abstract={We have fortuitously identified a nucleotide sequence that decreases expression of a reporter gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20-fold when inserted into an intron. The primary effect of the insertion is a decrease in {pre-mRNA} abundance accompanied by the appearance of 3'-truncated transcripts, consistent with premature transcriptional termination and/or {pre-mRNA} degradation. Point mutations in the cis element relieve the negative effect, demonstrating its sequence specificity. A novel yeast protein, named Nrd1, and a previously identified putative helicase, Sen1, help mediate the negative effect of the cis element. Sen1 is an essential nuclear protein that has been implicated in a variety of nuclear functions. Nrd1 has hallmarks of a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, including an {RNA} recognition motif, a region rich in {RE} and {RS} dipeptides, and a proline- and glutamine-rich domain. An N-terminal domain of Nrd1 may facilitate direct interaction with {RNA} polymerase {II.} Disruption of the {NRD1} gene is lethal, yet C-terminal truncations that delete the {RNA} recognition motif and abrogate the negative effect of the cis element nevertheless support cell growth. Thus, expression of a gene containing the cis element could be regulated through modulation of the activity of Nrd1. The recent identification of Nrd1-related proteins in mammalian cells suggests that this potential regulatory pathway is widespread among eukaryotes.},

The critical size and position of the heteroduplex region that alleviates the requirement for {TFIIE} and {TFIIH} is six nucleotides, from -4 to +2. Promoter opening was investigated directly with potassium permanganate {(KMnO4),} a chemical probe specific for single-stranded thymidines. We found that {KMnO4-detectable} opening of the {AdML} promoter requires the presence of the complete pre-initiation complex, {DBpolFEH,} and that opening occurs in two discrete steps. First, dependent on {ATP} but prior to initiation, the -9 to +1 region becomes single-stranded. Second, formation of the first phosphodiester bond results in expansion of the open region to the +8 position. Our results lead to a model in which the critical function of the {TFIIH-associated} {DNA} helicases is to create a single-stranded region. This gives {RNA} polymerase {II} access to the nucleotides of the template strand and allows expansion of the open region upon formation of the first phosphodiester bond.},

Accordingly, four deviations from previously proposed rules for third position wobble pairing in yeast, three {G:U} and one {A:I} codon-anticodon pairings, were found to be required to account for the reading of 61 coding triplets. The gene copy number for individual {tRNA} species, which ranges from one to 16, correlates well with both the frequency of codon occurrence in a sample of 1756 distinct protein coding sequences (r = 0.82) and the previously measured intracellular content of 21 {tRNA} species. A close link between {tRNA} gene redundancy and the overall amino acid composition of yeast proteins was also observed. Regression analysis values for individual protein coding sequences proved to be effective descriptions of the translational selective pressure operating on a particular gene. A significantly stronger co-adaptation between codon choice and {tRNA} gene copy number was observed in highly expressed genes. These observations strongly support the notion that intracellular {tRNA} levels in normally growing yeast cells are mainly determined by gene copy number, which, along with codon choice, is the key parameter acted upon by translational selection.},

This indicates that the {ATP-dependent} {DNA} helicase activity of {TFIIH} is required to maintain the open region only during formation of the first three phosphodiester bonds.

Here we present a detailed molecular dissection of this {ARS,} designated {ARS} 1501, and we demonstrate that it functions as a genomic replication origin on chromosome {XV} . Mutagenesis of the Abf1p {DNA-binding} sites revealed that these sequences did not contribute significantly to {ARS} function. Instead, a new {DNA} element important for replication, designated {REN1501,} has been located 5' to the T-rich strand of the {ACS.} We show that {REN1501} functions in either orientation and at variable distances from the {ACS,} defining this element as a {DNA} replication enhancer. Most significantly, point mutations within this element decreased the stability of plasmids bearing {ARS} 1501, suggesting that {REN1501} binds a protein important for replication initiation. Only three elements found at origins are known to specifically bind proteins. These include the {ARS} essential sequences and the Abf1p and Rap1p {DNA-binding} sites. We show that the function of {REN1501} at the origin cannot be replaced by a Rap1p {DNA-binding} site or a site that binds the transcriptional factor Gal4p and can only be partially substituted for by an Abf1p recognition sequence. This implies that the role of the {REN1501} element at the {ARS} 1501 origin is specific, and suggest that the frequency of origin firing in eukaryotic cells may be regulated by origin-specific enhancers.},

  abstract={Although it has been demonstrated that eukaryotic cellular origins of {DNA} replication may harbor stimulatory elements that bind transcription factors, how these factors stimulate origin function is unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the transcription factor Abf1p stimulates origin function of {ARS121} and {ARS1} . In the results presented here, an analysis of Abf1p function has been carried out utilizing {LexA(BD)-Abf1p} fusion proteins and an {ARS} 121 derivative harboring {LexA} {DNA-binding} sites. A minimal region which stimulates origin function mapped to 50 amino acids within the C-terminus of Abf1p. When tested for transcriptional activation of a {LacZ} reporter gene, the same {LexA(BD)-Abf1p} fusion protein had negligible transcriptional activation potential. Therefore, stimulation of {ARS} 121 may occur independently of a transcriptional activation domain. It has been previously observed that the Gal4p, Rap1p {DNA-binding} sites and the {LexA-Gal4p} fusion protein can replace the role of Abf1p in stimulating {ARS} 1 . Here we show that the stimulatory function of Abf1p at {ARS} 121 cannot be replaced by these alternative {DNA-binding} sites and the potent chimeric transcriptional activator {LexA(BD)-Gal4(AD)p} . Hence, these results strongly suggest that the Abf1p stimulation of replication may differ for {ARS} 121 and {ARS} 1 , and imply specificity in the {Abf1p/ARS} 121 relationship.},

We describe in this study how yeast Cdc6 protein stimulates Abf1 protein {DNA} binding activities. The Abf1 binding activity was reduced approximately 20-fold in a cdc6-1 mutant than in the wild-type strain. Introducing a copy of the wild-type {CDC6} gene into the cdc6-1 mutant strain restored the Abf1 {DNA} binding activity. We demonstrated that recombinant Abf1 binds to {ARS1} in vitro, and its {DNA} binding activity can be highly stimulated by the addition of a fusion glutathione S-transferase {(GST)-Cdc6} protein. Deletion analysis revealed that the stimulating region is located at the amino terminus of the Cdc6 protein. However, we could not find the direct physical interaction between Cdc6 and Abf1. Instead, we found that the {GST-Cdc6} can compete with distamycin A for binding to the {DNA} molecule. As distamycin A is a specific reagent that binds noncovalently to {DNA} at {(A} + T)-rich tracks, the stimulation of Abf1 {DNA} binding activity may be mediated by the {Cdc6/DNA} interaction. Our results favor a hypothesis that Cdc6 may function as an architectural factor in the assembly of a functional initiation replication complex.},

Nrd1 mediates a severe reduction in {pre-mRNA} production from a reporter gene bearing an exogenous sequence element in its intron. The effect of the inserted element is highly sequence-specific and is accompanied by the appearance of 3'-truncated transcripts. We have proposed that Nrd1 binds to the exogenous sequence element in the nascent {pre-mRNA} during transcription, aided by the {CTD-binding} motif, and directs 3'-end formation a short distance downstream. Here we show that highly purified Nrd1 carboxyl half binds tightly to the {RNA} element in vitro with sequence specificity that correlates with the efficiency of cis-element-directed down-regulation in vivo. A large deletion in the {CTD-binding} motif blocks down-regulation but does not affect the essential function of Nrd1. Furthermore, a nonsense mutant allele that produces truncated Nrd1 protein lacking the {RRM} has a dominant-negative effect on down-regulation but not on cell growth. Viability of this and several other nonsense alleles of Nrd1 appears to require translational readthrough, which in one case is extremely efficient. Thus the {CTD-binding} motif of Nrd1 is important for {pre-mRNA} down-regulation but is not required for the essential function of Nrd1. In contrast, the {RNA-binding} activity of Nrd1 appears to be required both for down-regulation and for its essential function.},

  abstract={A large body of evidence from viral systems has established that transcription factors play an important and direct role in activating viral {DNA} replication. Among the transcriptional activation domains that can stimulate viral {DNA} replication are acidic domains such as those derived from herpes simplex virus {VP16} and the tumor suppressor p53. Here we show that acidic activation domains can also activate a cellular origin of replication in a chromosomal context. When tethered to the yeast {ARS1} (autonomously replicating sequence 1) origin of replication, both {VP16} and p53 activation domains can enhance origin function. In addition, the C-terminal acidic region of the yeast transcription factor {ABF1,} which normally activates the {ARS1} origin, is sufficient for activating {ARS1} function when tethered to the origin. Mutations at residues Trp-53 and Phe-54 of a 20-residue (41 to 60) activation region of p53 abolish the activation of both replication and transcription, suggesting that the same structural determinants may be employed to activate both processes in yeast. Furthermore, using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method, we demonstrate that the {GAL4-p53} chimeric activator can activate initiation of chromosomal replication from an origin inserted at the native {ARS1} locus. These findings strongly suggest functional conservation of the mechanisms used by the acidic activation domains to activate viral {DNA} replication in mammalian cells and chromosomal replication in yeast.},

Hydrophobic patches in Sp1 and {CTF1} that mediate transcriptional activation in higher eukaryotes are also important for activation of replication in yeast. However, only the activation domain of {CTF1} can enhance initiation of replication from a chromosomally embedded origin.

The {CTF1-induced} chromatin remodeling occurs at multiple stages of the cell cycle.

  abstract={We have devised a cis-antisense rescue assay of cleavage and polyadenylation to determine how long it takes the simian virus 40 {(SV40)} early {poly(A)} signal to commit itself to processing in vivo. An inverted copy of the {poly(A)} signal placed immediately downstream of the authentic one inhibited processing by means of sense-antisense duplex formation in the {RNA.} The antisense inhibition was gradually relieved when the inverted signal was moved increasing distances downstream, presumably because cleavage and polyadenylation occur before the polymerase reaches the antisense sequence. Antisense inhibition was unaffected when the inverted signal was moved upstream. Based on the known rate of transcription, we estimate that the cleavage-polyadenylation process takes between 10 and 20 s for the {SV40} early {poly(A)} site to complete in vivo. Relief from inhibition occurred earlier for shorter antisense sequences than for longer ones. This indicates that a brief period of assembly is sufficient for the {poly(A)} signal to shield itself from a short (50- to 70-nucleotide) antisense sequence but that more assembly time is required for the signal to become immune to the longer ones (approximately 200 nucleotides). The simplest explanation for this target size effect is that the assembly process progressively sequesters more and more of the {RNA} surrounding the {poly(A)} signal up to a maximum of about 200 nucleotides, which we infer to be the domain of the mature apparatus. We compared strong and weak {poly(A)} sites. The {SV40} late {poly(A)} site, one of the strongest, assembles several times faster than the weaker {SV40} early or synthetic {poly(A)} site.},

Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that {SWI/SNF} uses the energy of {ATP} hydrolysis to antagonize chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. We have tested the possibility that {SWI/SNF} might also play a role in {DNA} replication. A mitotic minichromosome stability assay was used to investigate the replication efficiency of a variety of autonomous replication sequences {(ARSs)} in the presence and absence of {SWI/SNF.} The stability of minichromosomes that contain {ARS1,} {ARS309} or {ARS307} is not altered by lack of {SWI/SNF,} whereas the functioning of {ARS121} is crippled when {SWI/SNF} is inactivated. The {SWI/SNF} dependence of {ARS121} does not require the replication enhancer factor, {ABF1,} and thus, it appears to be a property of a minimal {ARS121} origin. Likewise, a minimal derivative of {ARS1} that lacks the {ABF1} replication enhancer acquires {SWI/SNF} dependence. Replacing the {ABF1} binding site at {ARS1} with a binding site for the {LexA-GAL4} chimeric activator also creates a {SWI/SNF-dependent} {ARS.} Our studies suggest that the {SWI/SNF} chromatin remodeling complex can play a role in both replication and transcription and, furthermore, that {SWI/SNF} dependence of {ARS} elements is a property of both an {ARS-specific} replication enhancer and the overall organization of {ARS} sequence elements.},

((1)) Both the high resolution structure of {SII} and the details of its novel mechanism of action have been refined through mutagenesis and sophisticated in vitro assays. {SII} engages transcribing pol {II} and assists it in bypassing blocks to elongation by stimulating a cryptic, nascent {RNA} cleavage activity intrinsic to {RNA} polymerase.

These observations have raised questions about whether the functions of the two complexes in vivo are unique or overlapping. Here we use genome-wide expression analysis to investigate how expression of the yeast genome depends on both shared and unique subunits of these two complexes. We find that expression of most genes requires one or more of the common {TAF(II)} subunits, indicating that the functions of {TFIID} and {SAGA} are widely required for gene expression. Among the subunits shared by {TFIID} and {SAGA} are three histone-like {TAF(II)s,} which have been proposed to form a sub-complex and mediate a common function in global transcription. Unexpectedly, we find that the histone-like {TAF(II)s} have distinct roles in expression of the yeast genome. Most importantly, we show that the histone acetylase components of {TFIID} and {SAGA} {(TAF(II)145} and Gcn5) are functionally redundant, indicating that expression of a large fraction of yeast genes can be regulated through the action of either complex.},

The present work demonstrates genetic and physical interactions among Nrd1p, the pol {II} {CTD,} Nab3p, and the {CTD} kinase {CTDK-I.} Previous studies have shown that Nrd1p associates with the {CTD} of pol {II} in yeast two-hybrid assays via its {CTD-interaction} domain {(CID).} We show that nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles are synthetically lethal with truncation of the {CTD} to 9 or 10 repeats. Nab3p, a yeast {hnRNP,} is a high-copy suppressor of some nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles, interacts with Nrd1p in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and coimmunoprecipitates with Nrd1p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of {NAB3} are suppressed by deletion of {CTK1,} a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate the {CTD} and increase elongation efficiency in vitro.

  abstract={A eukaryotic chromosome contains many genes, each transcribed separately by {RNA} polymerase (pol) I, {II} or {III.} Transcription termination between genes prevents the formation of polycistronic {RNAs} and anti-sense {RNAs,} which are generally detrimental to the correct expression of genes. Terminating the transcription of protein-coding genes by pol {II} requires a group of proteins that also direct cleavage and polyadenylation of the messenger {RNA} in response to a specific sequence element, and are associated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of pol {II} (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). By contrast, the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that direct termination of non-polyadenylated transcripts made by pol {II,} including small nucleolar and small nuclear {RNAs,} are not known. Here we show that read-through transcription from yeast small nucleolar {RNA} and small nuclear {RNA} genes into adjacent genes is prevented by a cis-acting element that is recognized, in part, by the essential {RNA-binding} protein Nrd1. The {RNA-binding} protein Nab3, the putative {RNA} helicase Sen1, and the intact C-terminal domain of pol {II} are also required for efficient response to the element. The same proteins are required for maintaining normal levels of Nrd1 {mRNA,} indicating that these proteins may control elongation of a subset of {mRNA} transcripts.},

Here we show that a {DNA-binding} protein could rely on the same biochemical activity that activates transcription to stimulate replication from the yeast chromosomal {ARS1} origin. Unexpectedly, the ability to stimulate replication from this origin was not restricted to polymerase {II} transcription factors, but was a property shared by polymerase {III} factors. Furthermore, activation of replication did not depend on the process of transcription, but rather on the ability of {DNA-binding} transcription factors to remodel chromatin. The natural {ARS1} activator Abf1 and the other transcription factors that stimulated replication remodeled chromatin in a very similar manner. Moreover, the presence of a histone H3 mutant that was previously shown to generally increase transcription also facilitated replication from {ARS1} and partially compensated for the absence of a transcription factor. We propose that multifunctional transcription factors work by influencing the chromatin architecture at replication origins so as to generate a structure that is favorable to the initiation of replication.},

Using these proteins as molecular landmarks for origins, we identified {ORC-} and {MCM-bound} sites throughout the yeast genome. Four hundred twenty-nine sites in the yeast genome were predicted to contain replication origins, and approximately 80\% of the loci identified on chromosome X demonstrated origin function. A substantial fraction of the predicted origins are associated with repetitive {DNA} sequences, including subtelomeric elements {(X} and Y') and transposable element-associated sequences (long terminal repeats).

  abstract={Annotation transfer is a principal process in genome annotation. It involves "transferring" structural and functional annotation to uncharacterized open reading frames {(ORFs)} in a newly completed genome from experimentally characterized proteins similar in sequence. To prevent errors in genome annotation, it is important that this process be robust and statistically well-characterized, especially with regard to how it depends on the degree of sequence similarity. Previously, we and others have analyzed annotation transfer in single-domain proteins. Multi-domain proteins, which make up the bulk of the {ORFs} in eukaryotic genomes, present more complex issues in functional conservation. Here we present a large-scale survey of annotation transfer in these proteins, using scop superfamilies to define domain folds and a thesaurus based on {SWISS-PROT} keywords to define functional categories. Our survey reveals that multi-domain proteins have significantly less functional conservation than single-domain ones, except when they share the exact same combination of domain folds. In particular, we find that for multi-domain proteins, approximate function can be accurately transferred with only 35\% certainty for pairs of proteins sharing one structural superfamily. In contrast, this value is 67\% for pairs of single-domain proteins sharing the same structural superfamily. On the other hand, if two multi-domain proteins contain the same combination of two structural superfamilies the probability of their sharing the same function increases to 80\% in the case of complete coverage along the full length of both proteins, this value increases further to \&gt; 90\%. Moreover, we found that only 70 of the current total of 455 structural superfamilies are found in both single and multi-domain proteins and only 14 of these were associated with the same function in both categories of proteins. We also investigated the degree to which function could be transferred between pairs of multi-domain proteins with respect to the degree of sequence similarity between them, finding that functional divergence at a given amount of sequence similarity is always about two-fold greater for pairs of multi-domain proteins (sharing similarity over a single domain) in comparison to pairs of single-domain ones, though the overall shape of the relationship is quite similar.

Known alternative 3'-processing sites, both within the 3'-untranslated region and within the protein coding sequence were successfully identified, leading to the possibility of prediction of previously unknown alternative sites.

Here we have shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1p and Abf1p proteins are endowed with a potent insulating capacity. Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors {(GRFs).} Thus {GRFs,} which bind to sites scattered throughout the genome within promoters, would not only play a key role in regulating gene expression but also partition the genome in functionally independent domains.},

  abstract={Genes encoding polyadenylated {mRNAs} depend on their {poly(A)} signals for termination of transcription. An unsolved problem is how the {poly(A)} signal triggers the polymerase to terminate. A popular model is that this occurs during extrusion of the {poly(A)} signal, at which time it interacts with factors on the transcription complex. To test this idea we used cis-antisense inhibition in vivo to probe the temporal relationship between {poly(A)} signal extrusion and the commitment of the polymerase to terminate. Our rationale was to inactivate the {poly(A)} signal at increasing times post-extrusion to determine the point beyond which it is no longer required for termination. We found that communication with the polymerase is not temporally restricted to the time of {poly(A)} signal extrusion, but is ongoing and perhaps random. Some polymerases terminate almost immediately. Others have yet to receive their termination instructions from the {poly(A)} signal even 500 bp downstream, as indicated by the ability of an antisense at this distance to block termination. Thus, the {poly(A)} signal can functionally interact with the polymerase at considerable distances down the template. This is consistent with the emerging picture of a processing apparatus that assembles and matures while riding with the polymerase.},

Ler sequence was used to confirm 117 of 121 {SFPs} and to determine the sensitivity of array hybridization.

A linear clustering algorithm was developed to identify clusters of {SFPs} representing potential deletions in 111 genes at a 5\% false discovery rate {(FDR).} Among the potential deletions were transposons, disease resistance genes, and genes involved in secondary metabolism. The applicability of this technique was demonstrated by genotyping a recombinant inbred line. Recombination break points could be clearly defined, and in one case delimited to an interval of 29 kb. We further demonstrate that array hybridization can be combined with bulk segregant analysis to quickly map mutations. The extension of these tools to organisms with complex genomes, such as Arabidopsis, will greatly increase our ability to map and clone quantitative trait loci {(QTL).}},

We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe {(PM} and {MM)} values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference {(AvDiff)} and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index {(MBEI).} The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average {(RMA)} of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA)} model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error {(SE)} to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

Mutation of each of the conserved residues predicted to coordinate metal ions in the active site of Rrp6p abolished activity of the enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Complete loss of Rrp6p activity caused by the {Y361F} and {Y361A} mutations supports the critical role proposed for the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr361 in the reaction mechanism. Rrp6p also contains an helicase {RNase} D C-terminal {(HRDC)} domain of unknown function that is similar to domains in the Werner's and Bloom's Syndrome proteins. A point mutation in this domain results in Rrp6p that localizes to the nucleus, but fails to efficiently process the 3' ends of {5.8S} {pre-rRNA} and some {pre-snoRNAs.} In contrast, this mutant retains the ability to degrade {rRNA} processing intermediates and 3'-extended, {poly(A)+} {snoRNAs.} These findings indicate the potential for independent control of the processing and degradation functions of Rrp6p.},

The nucleosome-specific pausing pattern of {RNAP} is comparable with that of Pol {II.} At physiological ionic strength or lower, the nucleosome blocks {RNAP} progression along the template, but this barrier can be relieved at higher ionic strength. Transcription through the nucleosome by {RNAP} results in the loss of an {H2A/H2B} dimer, and the histones that remain in the hexasome retain their original positions on the {DNA.} The results were similar for elongation complexes that were assembled from components (oligonucleotides and {RNAP)} and elongation complexes obtained by initiation from the promoter. The data suggest that eukaryotic Pol {II} and E. coli {RNAP} utilize very similar mechanisms for transcription through the nucleosome. Thus, bacterial {RNAP} can be used as a suitable model system to study general aspects of chromatin transcription by Pol {II.} Furthermore, the data argue that the general elongation properties of polymerases may determine the mechanism used for transcription through the nucleosome.},

One group of elongation factors {(Spt4/5,} {Spt6/Iws1,} and {Spt16/Pob3),} thought to mediate transcription through chromatin, shows patterns matching that of {RNApII.} In contrast, the Paf and {TREX/THO} complexes partially overlap {RNApII,} but do not crosslink to transcribed regions downstream of polyadenylation sites. In a complementary pattern, polyadenylation factors crosslink strongly at the 3' ends of genes. Mutation of the 3' polyadenylation sequences or the Rna14 protein causes loss of polyadenylation factor crosslinking and read-through of termination sequences. Therefore, transcription termination and polyadenylation involve transitions at the 3' end of genes that may include an exchange of elongation and polyadenylation/termination factors.},

Comparative genomics has recently been used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the yeast genome on the basis of phylogenetic conservation, but this information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional regulators occupy these binding sites. We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use of regulatory elements predicts mechanistic models for the function of a large population of yeast's transcriptional regulators.},

In the mouse, in vivo studies indicate that the cis-acting Sal boxes required for {rRNA} transcription termination are also involved in replication fork blockage. On the contrary, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {rRNA} transcription termination factors are not required for {RFBs.} Here we characterized the {rDNA} {RFBs} in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. pombe {rDNA} contains three closely spaced polar replication barriers named {RFB1,} {RFB2,} and {RFB3} in the 3' to 5' order. The transcription termination protein reb1 and its two binding sites, present at the 3' end of the coding region, were required for fork arrest at {RFB2} and {RFB3} in vivo. On the other hand, fork arrest at the strongest {RFB1} barrier was independent of the above transcription termination factors. Therefore, {RFB2} and {RFB3} resemble the barriers present in the mouse {rDNA,} whereas {RFB1} is similar to the budding yeast {RFBs.} These results suggest that during evolution, cis- and trans-acting factors required for {rRNA} transcription termination became involved in replication fork blockage also.

However, the precise mechanism of cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone of the {DNA} by the {NER} endonucleases and how this relates to removal of the damage-containing oligonucleotide during the excision process has not been determined. We previously isolated a stable heterotrimeric complex of {Rad7/Rad16/Abf1} from yeast which functions in the conserved global genome repair {(GGR)} pathway. {GGR} removes lesions from {DNA} that is not actively transcribing.

Here we report that this protein complex generates superhelicity in {DNA} through the catalytic activity of the Rad16 component. The torsion generated in the {DNA} by this complex is necessary to remove the damage-containing oligonucleotide during {NER--a} process referred to as excision.

Approximately 50\% of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription is devoted to {RP} genes. The transcriptional regulator Rap1 binds most yeast {RP} promoters, and Rap1 sites are important for coordinate regulation of {RP} genes. However, Rap1 is not the specific regulator that controls {RP} transcription because it also functions as a repressor, and many Rap1-activated promoters are not coordinately regulated with {RP} promoters. Here we show that the transcription factors Fhl1 and Ifh1 associate almost exclusively with {RP} promoters; association depends on Rap1 and (to a lesser extent) a {DNA} element at many {RP} promoters. Ifh1 is recruited to promoters via the forkhead-associated {(FHA)} domain of Fhl1; the level of Ifh1 associated with {RP} promoters determines the level of transcription; and environmental stress causes a marked reduction in the association of Ifh1, but not Fhl1 or Rap1. Thus, Ifh1 association with promoters is the key regulatory step for coordinate expression of {RP} genes.},

We found that all three forms of Pol {II} can complement Pol {II-depleted} extracts for transcription initiation, but Pol {II-TFIIF} has the highest specific activity.

The activity of these origins must be coordinated so that the entire genome is efficiently and accurately replicated yet no region of the genome is ever replicated more than once. The past decade has seen significant advances in understanding how the initiation of {DNA} replication is regulated by key cell-cycle regulators, including the cyclin dependent kinases {(CDKs)} and the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome {(APC/C).} The assembly of essential prereplicative complexes {(pre-RCs)} at origins only occurs when {CDK} activity is low and {APC/C} activity is high. Origin firing, however, can only occur when the {APC/C} is inactivated and {CDKs} become active. This two step mechanism ensures that no origin can fire more than once in a cell cycle. In all eukaryotes tested, {CDKs} can contribute to the inhibition of {pre-RC} assembly. This inhibition is characterised both by high degrees of redundancy and evolutionary plasticity. Geminin plays a crucial role in inhibiting licensing in metazoans and, like cyclins, is inactivated by the {APC/C.} Strategies involved in preventing re-replication in different organisms will be discussed.},

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} termination is triggered by sequences present in the nascent transcript. Termination of {pre-mRNA} transcription is coupled to recognition of cis-acting sequences that direct cleavage and polyadenylation of the {pre-mRNA.} Termination of nonpolyadenylated {[non-poly(A)]} Pol {II} transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3. We have used a mutational strategy to characterize {non-poly(A)} termination elements downstream of the {SNR13} and {SNR47} {snoRNA} genes. This approach detected two common {RNA} sequence motifs, {GUA[AG]} and {UCUU.} The first motif corresponds to the known Nrd1-binding site, which we have verified here by gel mobility shift assays. We also show that Nab3 protein binds specifically to {RNA} containing the {UCUU} motif. Taken together, our data suggest that Nrd1 and Nab3 binding sites play a significant role in defining {non-poly(A)} terminators. As is the case with {poly(A)} terminators, there is no strong consensus for {non-poly(A)} terminators, and the arrangement of Nrd1p and Nab3p binding sites varies considerably. In addition, the organization of these sequences is not strongly conserved among even closely related yeasts. This indicates a large degree of genetic variability. Despite this variability, we were able to use a computational model to show that the binding sites for Nrd1 and Nab3 can identify genes for which transcription termination is mediated by these proteins.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic protein-encoding genes possess {poly(A)} signals that define the end of the messenger {RNA} and mediate downstream transcriptional termination by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II).} Termination could occur through an 'anti-termination' mechanism whereby elongation factors dissociate when the {poly(A)} signal is encountered, producing termination-competent Pol {II.} An alternative 'torpedo' model postulated that {poly(A)} site cleavage provides an unprotected {RNA} 5' end that is degraded by 5' --\&gt; 3' exonuclease activities (torpedoes) and so induces dissociation of Pol {II} from the {DNA} template. This model has been questioned because unprocessed transcripts read all the way to the site of transcriptional termination before upstream polyadenylation. However, nascent transcripts located 1 kilobase downstream of the human beta-globin gene {poly(A)} signal are associated with a co-transcriptional cleavage {(CoTC)} activity that acts with the {poly(A)} signal to elicit efficient transcriptional termination. The {CoTC} sequence is an autocatalytic {RNA} structure that undergoes rapid self-cleavage. Here we show that {CoTC} acts as a precursor to termination by presenting a free {RNA} 5' end that is recognized by the human 5' --\&gt; 3' exonuclease Xrn2. Degradation of the downstream cleavage product by Xrn2 results in transcriptional termination, as envisaged in the torpedo model.},

  abstract={Regulation of ribosome biogenesis is central to the control of cell growth. In rapidly growing yeast cells, ribosomal protein {(RP)} genes account for approximately one-half of all polymerase {II} transcription-initiation events, yet these genes are markedly and coordinately downregulated in response to a number of environmental stress conditions, or during the transition from fermentation to respiration. Although several conserved signalling pathways {(TOR,} {RAS/protein} kinase A and protein kinase C) impinge upon {RP} gene transcription, little is known about how initiation at these genes is controlled. Rap1 (refs 6, 7) and more recently Fhl1 (ref. 8) were shown to bind upstream of many {RP} genes. Here we show that the essential protein Ifh1 binds to and activates many {RP} gene promoters under optimal growth conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ifh1 is recruited to {RP} gene promoters through the forkhead-associated domain of Fhl1. Ifh1 binding decreases when {RP} genes are downregulated either by {TOR} inhibition or nutrient depletion, and is restored after release from starvation or upon regulated induction of {IFH1} expression. These findings indicate a central role for Ifh1 and Fhl1 in {RP} gene regulation.},

Previously we have shown that {RAP1} can prevent nucleosome positioning in the vicinity of its binding site and have provided evidence that this ability to create a local region of "open" chromatin contributes to {RAP1} function at the {HIS4} promoter by facilitating binding and activation by {GCN4.} Here we examine and directly compare to that of {RAP1} the ability of {ABF1} to create a region of open chromatin near its binding site and to contribute to activated transcription at the {HIS4,} {ADE5,7,} and {HIS7} promoters. {ABF1} behaves similarly to {RAP1} in these assays, but it shows some subtle differences from {RAP1} in the character of the open chromatin region near its binding site. Furthermore, although the two factors can similarly enhance activated transcription at the promoters tested, {RAP1} binding is continuously required for this enhancement, but {ABF1} binding is not.

Cbf1p is a sequence-specific {DNA} binding protein required for {MET16} chromatin remodelling. Irrespective of the level of transcription, repair at the {MspI} restriction fragment of {MET16} exhibits periodicity in line with nucleosome positions in both strands of the regulatory region and the non-transcribed strand of the coding region. However, repair in the coding region of the {TS} is always faster, but exhibits periodicity only when {MET16} is repressed. In general, absence of Cbf1p decreased repair in the sequences examined, although the effects were more dramatic in the Cbf1p remodelled area, with repair being reduced to the lowest levels within the nucleosome cores of this region. Our results indicate that repair at the promoter and coding regions of this lowly transcribed gene are dependent on both chromatin structure and the level of transcription.

At {MET} genes Cbf1p appears to function in both activator recruitment and chromatin-remodeling. Cbf1p has been implicated in the regulation of other genes, and {CACRTG} motifs are common in potential gene regulatory {DNA.} A recent genome-wide location analysis showed that the majority of intergenic {CACGTG} palindromes are bound by Cbf1p. Here we tested whether all potential Cbf1p binding motifs in the yeast genome are likely to be bound by Cbf1p using chromatin immunoprecipitation. We also tested which of the motifs are actually functional by assaying for Cbf1p-dependent chromatin remodeling. We show that Cbf1p binding and activity is restricted to palindromic {CACGTG} motifs in promoter-proximal regions. Cbf1p does not function through {CACGTG} motifs that occur in promoter-distal locations within coding regions nor where {CACATG} motifs occur alone except at centromeres. Cbf1p can be made to function at promoter-distal {CACGTG} motifs by overexpression, suggesting that the concentration of Cbf1p is normally limiting for binding and is biased to gene regulatory {DNA} by interactions with other factors. We conclude that Cbf1p is required for normal nucleosome positioning wherever the {CACGTG} motif occurs in gene regulatory {DNA.} Cbf1p has been shown to interact with the chromatin-remodeling {ATPase} Isw1p.

Strikingly, {SAGA-dominated} genes are largely stress induced and {TAF} independent, and are downregulated by the coordinate action of a variety of chromatin, {TBP,} and {RNA} polymerase {II} regulators. In contrast, the {TFIID-dominated} class is less regulated, but is highly dependent upon {TAFs,} including those shared between {TFIID} and {SAGA.} These two distinct modes of transcription regulation might reflect the need to balance inducible stress responses with the steady output of housekeeping genes.},

They are loaded onto replication origins during G1 phase of the cell cycle to form a pre-replication complex {(pre-RC)} that licenses each origin for subsequent initiation. We have investigated the {DNA} elements that determine the dependence of yeast replication origins on Mcm2-7 activity, i.e. the sensitivity of an origin to mcm mutations. Using chimaeric constructs from mcm sensitive and mcm insensitive origins, we have identified two main elements affecting the requirement for Mcm2-7 function. First, transcription into an origin increases its dependence on Mcm2-7 function, revealing a conflict between {pre-RC} assembly and transcription. Second, sequence elements within the minimal origin influence its mcm sensitivity. Replication origins show similar differences in sensitivity to mutations in other {pre-RC} proteins (such as Origin Recognition Complex and Cdc6), but not to mutations in initiation and elongation factors, demonstrating that the mcm sensitivity of an origin is determined by its ability to establish a {pre-RC.} We propose that there is a hierarchy of replication origins with respect to the range of {pre-RC} protein concentrations under which they will function. This hierarchy is both 'hard-wired' by the minimal origin sequences and 'soft-wired' by local transcriptional context.},

The results presented here reveal a new role of yeast {RNase} {III} in the processing of intron-encoded {snoRNAs} that permits independent regulation of the host {mRNA} and its associated {snoRNA.}},

We developed a tiled microarray approach to identify at high resolution the translational positions of 2278 nucleosomes over 482 kilobases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {DNA,} including almost all of chromosome {III} and 223 additional regulatory regions. The majority of the nucleosomes identified were well-positioned. We found a stereotyped chromatin organization at Pol {II} promoters consisting of a nucleosome-free region approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start codon flanked on both sides by positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free sequences were evolutionarily conserved and were enriched in poly-deoxyadenosine or poly-deoxythymidine sequences. Most occupied transcription factor binding motifs were devoid of nucleosomes, strongly suggesting that nucleosome positioning is a global determinant of transcription factor access.},

Here we report that two exonucleases, Rat1 and Xrn1, both contribute to cotranscriptional degradation of nascent {RNA,} but this degradation is not sufficient to cause polymerase release.

In addition, the cleavage factor Pcf11 reciprocally aids in recruitment of Rat1 to the elongation complex.

To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription {factor-DNA} interactions to quantitatively model {SELEX.} We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor {CTF/NFI.} From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

Biochemical analysis reveals that {dPcf11} dismantles elongation complexes by a {CTD-dependent} but nucleotide-independent mechanism and that {dPcf11} forms a bridge between the {CTD} and {RNA.} This bridge appears to be crucial because an {anti-CTD} antibody, which also dismantles the elongation complex, is found to bridge the {CTD} to {RNA.} {dPcf11} was observed to inhibit transcription at low, but not high, nucleotide levels, suggesting that {dPcf11} dismantles paused elongation complexes.

  abstract={Spliceosome assembly in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recently shown to occur at the site of transcription. However, evidence for cotranscriptional splicing as well as for coupling between transcription and splicing is still lacking. Using modifications of a previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation {(ChIP)} assay, we show that cotranscriptional splicing occurs approximately 1 kb after transcription of the 3' splice site {(3'SS).} This pathway furthermore protects most intron-containing nascent transcripts from the effects of cleavage by an intronic hammerhead ribozyme. This suggests that a high percentage of introns are recognized cotranscriptionally. This observation led us to screen a small deletion library for strains that sensitize a splicing reporter to ribozyme cleavage. Characterization of the Deltamud2 strain indicates that the early splicing factor Mud2p functions with U1 {snRNP} to form a cross-intron bridging complex on nascent {pre-mRNA.} The complex helps protect the transcript from ribozyme-mediated destruction and suggests an intron-definition event early in the spliceosome assembly process. The transcription elongation mutant strains Deltadst1 and Deltapaf1 show different cotranscriptional splicing phenotypes, suggesting that different transcription pathways differentially impact the efficiency of nascent intron definition.},

  abstract={Replication origins in a genome are inherently different in their base sequence and in their response to temporal and cell cycle regulation signals for {DNA} replication. To investigate the chromosomal determinants that influence the efficiency of initiation of {DNA} replication genome-wide, we made use of a reverse strategy originally used for the isolation of replication initiation mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, replication origins isolated from chromosomes support the autonomous replication of plasmids. These replication origins, whether in the context of a chromosome or a plasmid, will initiate efficiently in wild-type cells but show a dramatically contrasted efficiency of activation in mutants defective in the early steps of replication initiation. Serial passages of a genomic library of autonomously replicating sequences {(ARSs)} in such a mutant allowed us to select for constitutively active {ARSs.} We found a hierarchy of preferential initiation of {ARSs} that correlates with local transcription patterns. This preferential usage is enhanced in mutants defective in the assembly of the prereplication complex {(pre-RC)} but not in mutants defective in the activation of the {pre-RC.} Our findings are consistent with an interference of local transcription with the assembly of the {pre-RC} at a majority of replication origins.},

  abstract={The ribosomal protein genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responsible for nearly 40\% of the polymerase {II} transcription initiation events, are characterized by the constitutive tight binding of the transcription factor Rap1. Rap1 binds at many places in the yeast genome, including glycolytic enzyme genes, the silent {MAT} loci, and telomeres, its specificity arising from specific cofactors recruited at the appropriate genes. At the ribosomal protein genes two such cofactors have recently been identified as Fhl1 and Ifh1. We have now characterized the interaction of these factors at a bidirectional ribosomal protein promoter by replacing the Rap1 sites with {LexA} operator sites. {LexA-Gal4(AD)} drives active transcription at this modified promoter, although not always at the correct initiation site. Tethering Rap1 to the promoter neither drives transcription nor recruits Fhl1 or Ifh1, showing that Rap1 function requires direct {DNA} binding. Tethering Fhl1 also fails to activate transcription, even though it does recruit Ifh1, suggesting that Fhl1 does more than simply provide a platform for Ifh1. Tethering Ifh1 to the promoter leads to low-level transcription, at the correct initiation sites. Remarkably, activation by tethered {LexA-Gal4(AD)} is strongly reduced when {TOR} kinase is inhibited by rapamycin. Thus, {TOR} can act independently of {Fhl1/Ifh1} at ribosomal protein promoters. We also show that, in our strain background, the response of ribosomal protein promoters to {TOR} inhibition is independent of the Ifh1-related protein Crf1, indicating that the role of this corepressor is strain specific. Fine-structure chromatin mapping of several ribosomal protein promoters revealed that histones are essentially absent from the Rap1 sites, while Fhl1 and Ifh1 are coincident with each other but distinct from Rap1.},

Small nucleolar {RNAs} {(snoRNAs)} are also transcribed by {RNA} polymerase {II} but are not polyadenylated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that polyadenylation factors and Rat1 localize to {snoRNA} genes, but mutations that disrupt {poly(A)} site cleavage or Rat1 activity do not lead to termination defects at these genes. Conversely, mutations of Nrd1, Sen1, and Ssu72 affect termination at {snoRNAs} but not at several {mRNA} genes. The exosome complex was required for 3' trimming, but not termination, of {snoRNAs.} Both the {mRNA} and {snoRNA} pathways require Pcf11 but show differential effects of individual mutant alleles.

Nonetheless, a complete understanding of the complexity of the {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription cycle necessitated the development of assays that include chromatinized {DNA} templates. At this time, the field was actively searching for factors that allow transcription initiation on chromatinized templates. We began studies using chromatin templates in an attempt to identify factor(s) that permit {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes, i.e. that allow elongation on chromatinized {DNA} templates. The challenge herein was to develop an assay that directly measured the ability of transcriptionally engaged {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes. This approach resulted in the isolation of {FACT,} a heterodimer in humans comprised of Spt16 and {SSRP1.} Defined functional biochemical assays corroborated genetic studies in yeast that allowed the elucidation of {FACT} function in vivo. Collectively, these approaches demonstrate that {FACT} is a factor that allows {RNA} polymerase {II} to traverse nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo by removing one {H2A/H2B} dimer. More recent studies using a fully defined chromatin reconstitution/transcription assay revealed that {FACT} activity is greatly stimulated by post-translational modification of the histone polypeptides, specifically by monoubiquitination of lysine 120 of human histone {H2B.}},

  abstract={Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

  abstract={In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, silencers flanking the {HML} and {HMR} loci consist of various combinations of binding sites for Abf1p, Rap1p, and the origin recognition complex {(ORC)} that serve to recruit the Sir silencing complex, thereby initiating the establishment of transcriptionally silent chromatin. There have been seemingly conflicting reports concerning whether silencers function in an orientation-dependent or -independent manner, and what determines the directionality of a silencer has not been explored. We demonstrate that chromatin plays a key role in determining the potency and directionality of silencers. We show that nucleosomes are asymmetrically distributed around the {HML-I} or {HMR-E} silencer so that a nucleosome is positioned close to the Abf1p side but not the {ORC} side of the silencer. This coincides with preferential association of Sir proteins and transcriptional silencing on the Abf1p side of the silencer. Elimination of the asymmetry in nucleosome positioning at a silencer leads to comparable silencing on both sides. Asymmetric nucleosome positioning in the immediate vicinity of a silencer is independent of its orientation and genomic context, indicating that it is the inherent property of the silencer. Moreover, it is also independent of the Sir complex and thus precedes the formation of silent chromatin. Finally, we demonstrate that asymmetric positioning of nucleosomes and directional silencing by a silencer depend on {ORC} and Abf1p. We conclude that the {HML-I} and {HMR-E} silencers promote asymmetric positioning of nucleosomes, leading to unequal potentials of transcriptional silencing on their sides and, hence, directional silencing.},

  abstract={{HMG} proteins are architectural proteins that bind to {DNA} with low sequence specificity, but little is known about their genomic location and biological functions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes 10 {HMG} proteins, including Hmo1, which is important for maximal transcription of {rRNA.} Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis to determine the genome-wide association of Hmo1. Unexpectedly, Hmo1 binds strongly to the promoters of most ribosomal protein {(RP)} genes and to a number of other specific genomic locations. Hmo1 binding to {RP} promoters requires Rap1 and (to a lesser extent) Fhl1, proteins that also associate with {RP} promoters. Hmo1, like Fhl1 and Ifh1, typically associates with an {IFHL} motif in {RP} promoters, but deletion of the {IFHL} motif has a very modest effect on Hmo1 binding. Surprisingly, loss of Hmo1 abolishes binding of Fhl1 and Ifh1 to {RP} promoters but does not significantly affect the level of transcriptional activity. These results suggest that Hmo1 is required for the assembly of transcription factor complexes containing Fhl1 and Ifh1 at {RP} promoters and that proteins other than Fhl1 and Ifh1 also play an important role in {RP} transcription. Lastly, like mammalian {UBF,} Hmo1 associates at many locations throughout the {rRNA} gene locus, and it is important for processing of {rRNA} in addition to its role in {rRNA} transcription. We speculate that Hmo1 has a role in coordinating the transcription of {rRNA} and {RP} genes.},

A total of 85\% of the genome is expressed in rich media. Apart from expected transcripts, we found operon-like transcripts, transcripts from neighboring genes not separated by intergenic regions, and genes with complex transcriptional architecture where different parts of the same gene are expressed at different levels. We mapped the positions of 3' and 5' {UTRs} of coding genes and identified hundreds of {RNA} transcripts distinct from annotated genes. These nonannotated transcripts, on average, have lower sequence conservation and lower rates of deletion phenotype than protein coding genes. Many other transcripts overlap known genes in antisense orientation, and for these pairs global correlations were discovered: {UTR} lengths correlated with gene function, localization, and requirements for regulation; antisense transcripts overlapped 3' {UTRs} more than 5' {UTRs;} {UTRs} with overlapping antisense tended to be longer; and the presence of antisense associated with gene function. These findings may suggest a regulatory role of antisense transcription in S. cerevisiae.

Having the potential of bringing enormous technical and economical advantages to drug discovery, the new application suffers from unpredictable performances. To gain an insight of the new method, we develop a computer model to numerically analyze the subtractive {SELEX} alternatively against two distinct heterogeneous samples of unknown targets. The model features the discretization of ligand library, the ligand-target binding equilibrium equations, and the separation efficiency of bound and unbound ligands in experiments. By computer simulations, we investigate how aptamers for desired targets embedded in undefined target mixtures are generated under different experimental conditions. We find the iterative screening scheme is fundamentally capable of developing desired aptamers. On the other hand, target sample configuration and separation efficiency may all together significantly diversify the screening dynamics and results.},

  abstract={The core promoter of eukaryotic genes is the minimal {DNA} region that recruits the basal transcription machinery to direct efficient and accurate transcription initiation. The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the {TATA} box and the initiator {(INR)} remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for {TATA-less} genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that approximately 76\% of human core promoters lack {TATA-like} elements, have a high {GC} content, and are enriched in Sp1-binding sites. We further identify two motifs - M3 {(SCGGAAGY)} and M22 {(TGCGCANK)} - that occur preferentially in human {TATA-less} core promoters. About 24\% of human genes have a {TATA-like} element and their promoters are generally {AT-rich;} however, only approximately 10\% of these {TATA-containing} promoters have the canonical {TATA} box {(TATAWAWR).} In contrast, approximately 46\% of human core promoters contain the consensus {INR} {(YYANWYY)} and approximately 30\% are {INR-containing} {TATA-less} genes. Significantly, approximately 46\% of human promoters lack both {TATA-like} and consensus {INR} elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type {INR} sequences are present - and tend to cluster - in the transcription start site {(TSS)} region of approximately 40\% of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that {TATA-less} genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic "housekeeping" processes, while {TATA-containing} genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli. These results reveal unexpected similarities in the occurrence of specific core promoter types and in their associated biological processes in yeast and humans and point to novel vertebrate-specific {DNA} motifs that might play a selective role in {TATA-independent} transcription.},

Here, highly purified proteins and a protein dissociation assay were used to investigate whether the {RNAPII.Mediator} complex {(holo-RNAPII)} can be disrupted by {CTD} phosphorylation, thereby severing one of the bonds that stabilize promoter-associated initiation complexes. We report that {CTD} phosphorylation by the serine 5-specific {TFIIH} complex, or its kinase module {TFIIK,} is indeed sufficient to dissociate {holo-RNAPII.} Surprisingly, phosphorylation by the {CTD} serine 2-specific kinase {CTDK1} also results in dissociation. Moreover, the Mediator-induced stimulation of {CTD} phosphorylation previously reported for {TFIIH} is also observed with {CTDK1} kinase. An unrelated {CTD-binding} protein, Rsp5, is capable of stimulating this {CTD} kinase activity as well. These data shed new light on mechanisms that drive the {RNAPII} transcription cycle and suggest a mechanism for the enhancement of {CTD} kinase activity by the Mediator complex.},

This study provides, in addition to the identification of the E3 required for Pol {II} polyubiquitylation and degradation in yeast cells, the first evidence for a specific function in yeast for a member of the elongin {C/BC-box} protein/cullin family of ligases. Also, these observations raise the distinct possibility that the elongin C-containing ubiquitin ligase, the von {Hippel-Lindau} tumor suppressor complex, promotes Pol {II} polyubiquitylation and degradation in human cells.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} are thought to be degraded in the nucleus by a process involving polyadenylation and 3'-to-5' degradation by the nuclear exosome. In this work, we examine the degradation pathway of the {RNA} {SRG1,} which is produced from an intergenic region and contributes to the regulation of the {SER3} gene by promoter occlusion during {SRG1} transcription. Although there is some effect on {SRG1} transcript levels when the nuclear exosome is compromised, the bulk of the {SRG1} {RNA} is degraded in the cytoplasm by decapping and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic digestion. Examination of other {CUTs} suggests that individual {CUTs} can be degraded by a variety of different mechanisms, including nuclear decay, cytoplasmic decapping and 5'-to-3' decay, and nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, some {CUTs} appear to be associated with polyribosomes. These results indicate that some {CUTs} can be exported from the nucleus and enter translation before being degraded, identifying a potential mechanism for the evolution of new protein-encoding genes.},

Clinical cytogeneticists need to differentiate between copy number variants {(CNVs)} that are likely to be pathogenic and {CNVs} that are less likely to contribute to an affected individual's clinical presentation. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the phenotypic effects of most {CNVs} is minimal, leading to the classification of many {CNVs} as genomic imbalances of unknown clinical significance. This has caused many laboratories to resist the use of higher-resolution genome-wide array {CGH} assays for clinical purposes. Ironically, the accumulation and annotation of such array {CGH} data can lead to the rapid identification of pathogenic {CNVs} and the definition of new genomic syndromes that, in turn, are useful for accurate clinical genetic diagnoses.},

  abstract={Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment {(SELEX)} is an important technology in combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology of developing high affinity target-binding molecules (aptamers) from highly complex nucleic acid ligand libraries. Schematically, the {SELEX} is a series of iterative rounds of operations where in each operational round ligands are incubated with the target (e.g., a purified protein), and target-binding ligands are extracted and amplified. In the recent development of biological study and drug discovery, by incubating ligand libraries with complex target mixtures (e.g., cell fragments), the {SELEX} experiments have been explored to simultaneously develop aptamers for targets embedded in target mixtures: the complex {SELEX.} While holding the considerable advantages of saving experimental resources, practicing the complex {SELEX} has often accompanied with unstable experimental performances. It is therefore important to understand the behaviors of the new application. In this paper, we develop stochastic computer model, and customized computational algorithm to numerically mimic the complex {SELEX.} We model the ligand selection through the probability of ligand binding to complex targets at the binding equilibrium, and efficiency of separating target-binders for amplification. The customized computational algorithm allows us to simulate real experiments that operate on huge ligand libraries. We evaluate the ligand evolution, and aptamer enrichment of complex {SELEX} under various experimental conditions by stochastic simulations, and theorize the simulated results. We argue that the stochastic effects, which were not previously captured in the studies of complex {SELEX,} may significantly affect the results of experiments.},

Rtt103 and Pcf11 act in {mRNA} termination, and both preferentially interact with {CTD} phosphorylated at Ser2. The crystal structure of the Nrd1 {CID} shows a fold similar to that of Pcf11, but Nrd1 preferentially binds to {CTD} phosphorylated at Ser5, the form found proximal to promoters. This indicates why Nrd1 cross-links near 5' ends of genes and why the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} termination pathway acts specifically at short Pol {II-transcribed} genes. Nrd1 recruitment to genes involves a combination of interactions with {CTD} and Nab3.},

Overexpressing a C-terminal fragment of Sen1, a superfamily I helicase required for {snoRNA} termination, suppresses the growth and termination defects associated with loss of Swd2 or Ref2, but not Glc7. Suppression by Sen1 requires nuclear localization and direct interaction with Glc7, which can dephosphorylate Sen1 in vitro.

  abstract={The {IMD2} gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by intracellular guanine nucleotides. Regulation is exerted through the choice of alternative transcription start sites that results in synthesis of either an unstable short transcript terminating upstream of the start codon or a full-length productive {IMD2} {mRNA.} Start site selection is dictated by the intracellular guanine nucleotide levels. Here we have mapped the polyadenylation sites of the upstream, unstable short transcripts that form a heterogeneous family of {RNAs} of approximately 200 nucleotides. The switch from the upstream to downstream start sites required the Rpb9 subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II.} The enzyme's ability to locate the downstream initiation site decreased exponentially as the start was moved downstream from the {TATA} box. This suggests that {RNA} polymerase {II's} pincer grip is important as it slides on {DNA} in search of a start site. Exosome degradation of the upstream transcripts was highly dependent upon the distance between the terminator and promoter. Similarly, termination was dependent upon the Sen1 helicase when close to the promoter. These findings extend the emerging concept that distinct modes of termination by {RNA} polymerase {II} exist and that the distance of the terminator from the promoter, as well as its sequence, is important for the pathway chosen.},

We show that synthesis of independently transcribed {snoRNAs} involves default polyadenylation of two classes of precursors derived from termination at a main {Nrd1/Nab3-dependent} site or a "fail-safe" {mRNA-like} signal. {Poly(A)} tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative {poly(A)} polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the {exosome/Rrp6.} A more important role of {Trf4/TRAMP,} however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with {snoRNA} genes.

The protein is thought to exert its functions via specific interaction with its target site as part of distinct protein complexes, but its roles during mitotic growth and meiotic development are only partially understood. Here, we report a comprehensive approach aiming at the identification of direct Abf1-target genes expressed during fermentation, respiration, and sporulation. Computational prediction of the protein's target sites was integrated with a genome-wide {DNA} binding assay in growing and sporulating cells. The resulting data were combined with the output of expression profiling studies using wild-type versus temperature-sensitive alleles. This work identified 434 protein-coding loci as being transcriptionally dependent on Abf1. More than 60\% of their putative promoter regions contained a computationally predicted Abf1 binding site and/or were bound by Abf1 in vivo, identifying them as direct targets. The present study revealed numerous loci previously unknown to be under Abf1 control, and it yielded evidence for the protein's variable {DNA} binding pattern during mitotic growth and meiotic development.},

However, less is known about the functional consequences of this encoding. Here, we address this question using a genome-wide map of approximately 380,000 yeast nucleosomes that we sequenced in their entirety. Utilizing the high resolution of our map, we refine our understanding of how nucleosome organizations are encoded by the {DNA} sequence and demonstrate that the genomic sequence is highly predictive of the in vivo nucleosome organization, even across new nucleosome-bound sequences that we isolated from fly and human. We find that {Poly(dA:dT)} tracts are an important component of these nucleosome positioning signals and that their nucleosome-disfavoring action results in large nucleosome depletion over them and over their flanking regions and enhances the accessibility of transcription factors to their cognate sites. Our results suggest that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to regulate gene expression with different transcriptional noise and activation kinetics and {DNA} replication with different origin efficiency. These distinct functions may be achieved by encoding both relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations over some factor binding sites, where factors must compete with nucleosomes for {DNA} access, and relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) organizations over other factor sites, where factors bind without competition.},

In this paper, we will begin by introducing some of the most advanced existing software packages for simulating cardiac electrical activity. We consider the software development methods used in producing codes of this type, and discuss their use of numerical algorithms, relative computational efficiency, usability, robustness and extensibility. We then go on to describe a class of software development methodologies known as test-driven agile methods and argue that such methods are more suitable for scientific software development than the traditional academic approaches. A case study is a project of our own, Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment, which is a library of computational biology software that began as an experiment in the use of agile programming methods. We present our experiences with a review of our progress thus far, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared with the development methods used in some existing packages. We conclude by considering whether the likely wider needs of the cardiac modelling community are currently being met and suggest that, in order to respond effectively to changing requirements, it is essential that these codes should be more malleable. Such codes will allow for reliable extensions to include both detailed mathematical models--of the heart and other organs--and more efficient numerical techniques that are currently being developed by many research groups worldwide.},

  abstract={A major limitation of chromatin immunoprecipitation lies in the challenge of measuring the immunoprecipitation effectiveness of different proteins and antibodies and the resultant inability to compare the occupancies of different {DNA-binding} proteins. Here we present the implementation of a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in the {RNA} polymerase {III} (pol {III)} system that allowed us to measure the absolute in vivo occupancy of pol {III} and its two transcription factors, {TFIIIC} and {TFIIIB,} on a subset of pol {III} genes. The crucial point of our analysis was devising a method that allows the accurate determination of the immunoprecipitation efficiency for each protein. We achieved this by spiking every immunoprecipitation reaction with the formaldehyde cross-linked in vitro counterparts of {TFIIIB-,} {TFIIIC-,} and pol {III-DNA} complexes, measuring the in vitro occupancies of the corresponding factors on a {DNA} probe and determining probe recovery by quantitative {PCR.} Analysis of nine pol {III-transcribed} genes with diverse sequence characteristics showed a very high occupancy by {TFIIIB} and pol {III} (pol {III} occupancy being generally approximately 70\% of {TFIIIB} occupancy) and a {TFIIIC} occupancy that ranged between approximately 5 and 25\%. Current data suggest that {TFIIIC} is released during transcription in vitro, and it has been proposed that {TFIIIB} suffices for pol {III} recruitment in vivo. Our findings point to the transient nature of the {TFIIIC-DNA} interaction in vivo, with no significant counter-correlation between pol {III} and {TFIIIC} occupancy and instead to a dependence of {TFIIIB-DNA} and {TFIIIC-DNA} complex maintenance in vivo on pol {III} function.},

Here, we describe systematic determination of yeast transcription factor {DNA-binding} specificities. We obtained binding specificities for 112 {DNA-binding} proteins representing 19 distinct structural classes. One-third of the binding specificities have not been previously reported. Several binding sequences have striking genomic distributions relative to transcription start sites, supporting their biological relevance and suggesting a role in promoter architecture. Among these are Rsc3 binding sequences, containing the core {CGCG,} which are found preferentially approximately 100 bp upstream of transcription start sites. Mutation of {RSC3} results in a dramatic increase in nucleosome occupancy in hundreds of proximal promoters containing a Rsc3 binding element, but has little impact on promoters lacking Rsc3 binding sequences, indicating that Rsc3 plays a broad role in targeting nucleosome exclusion at yeast promoters.},

Here, we show that an antisense {TY1} {CUT,} starting within the Ty1 retrotransposon and encompassing the promoter 5' long terminal repeat {(LTR),} mediates {RNA-dependent} gene silencing and represses Ty1 mobility. We show that the Ty1 regulatory {RNA} is synthesized by {RNA} polymerase {II,} polyadenylated, and destabilized by the cytoplasmic 5' {RNA} degradation pathway. Moreover, the Ty1 regulatory {RNA} represses Ty1 transcription and transposition in trans by acting on the de novo transcribed {TY1} {RNA.} Consistent with a transcriptional regulation mechanism, we show that {RNA} polymerase {II} occupancy is reduced on the Ty1 chromatin upon silencing, although {TBP} binding remains unchanged. Furthermore, the Ty1 silencing is partially mediated by histone deacetylation and requires Set1-dependent histone methylation, pointing out an analogy with heterochromatin gene silencing. Our results show the first example of an {RNA-dependent} gene trans-silencing mediated by epigenetic marks in S. cerevisiae.},

  abstract={Pervasive and hidden transcription is widespread in eukaryotes, but its global level, the mechanisms from which it originates and its functional significance are unclear. Cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} were recently described as a principal class of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the {Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP} complexes. Although {CUT} degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of {CUTs} are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of {CUTs} in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional {CUTs} and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An {RNA} fraction highly enriched in {CUTs} was analysed by a 3' {Long-SAGE} (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of {CUTs} revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of {CUTs} predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the {CUTs} start upstream from messenger {RNAs} and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new {CUTs} with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified {CUTs} corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels.},

The deletion of the mitochondrial genome {(mtDNA)} and, hence, the ability to respire, affects expression of several nuclear genes through at least two different mitochondrial-nuclear communication pathways. One of the pathways, retrograde regulation, is activated by a reduction in respiration, while another, intergenomic signaling, is unaffected by respiration but requires {mtDNA.} Using {DNA} microarrays, we identify here a set of nuclear genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are targets of intergenomic signaling. These nuclear genes are down-regulated in rho degrees cells that lack {mtDNA} but not in nuclear pet mutant rho(+)cells that possess {mtDNA} but lack respiration. Many of these nuclear genes encode mitochondrial proteins, implying that intergenomic signaling functions in coordinating mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression. In addition, analyses of deletion and linker scanning mutations in the promoter of the {COX6} gene, a nuclear gene affected by intergenomic signaling, suggest an involvement of Abf1p transcription factor in intergenomic signaling. Together, these findings indicate that intergenomic signaling is distinct from retrograde regulation both in the nuclear genes that it regulates and in the way in which it affects their expression.},

Pausing occurs on average every 100 bases of {DNA.} Several models have been proposed to explain pausing, including backtracking of the ternary elongation complex, delay of translocation of the enzyme along {DNA,} or a conformational change in the active site preventing formation of the phosphodiester bond. Here, we performed biochemical characterization of previously-reported pauses of Escherichia coli {RNAP} and found that they are not associated with backtracking or a translocation delay. Instead, the paused complex contains the 3' end of the transcript in the active center and is capable of binding the next cognate {NTP.} However, bond formation occurs much slower in the paused complex compared with its fully-active counterpart. The pausing is dramatically decreased by a substitution of the base encoding the next incoming {NTP} and the base encoding the 3' end of the nascent {RNA,} suggesting that (mis)-alignment of the 3' end of the {RNA} and the incoming {NTP} in the active site is crucial for pausing. These pause sites are conserved between E. coli and Thermus thermophilus {RNAPs,} but are not recognized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {RNAP} {II,} indicating that prokaryotic {RNAPs} might be more sensitive to the changes in the alignment of the nascent transcript and the substrate {NTP} in the active site.},

  abstract={Histone modifications are a crucial source of epigenetic control. {SAGA} {(Spt-Ada-Gcn5} acetyltransferase) is a chromatin-modifying complex that contains two distinct enzymatic activities, Gcn5 and Ubp8, through which it acetylates and deubiquitinates histone residues, respectively, thereby enforcing a pattern of modifications that is decisive in regulating gene expression. Here, I discuss the latest contributions to understanding the roles of the {SAGA} complex, highlighting the characterization of the {SAGA-deubiquitination} module, and emphasizing the functions newly ascribed to {SAGA} during transcription elongation and {messenger-RNA} export. These findings suggest that a crosstalk exists between chromatin remodelling, transcription and {messenger-RNA} export, which could constitute a checkpoint for accurate gene expression. I focus particularly on the new components of human {SAGA,} which was recently discovered and confirms the conservation of the {SAGA} complex throughout evolution.},

  abstract={In vitro selection of {RNA} aptamers that bind to a specific ligand usually begins with a random pool of {RNA} sequences. We propose a computational approach for designing a starting pool of {RNA} sequences for the selection of {RNA} aptamers for specific analyte binding. Our approach consists of three steps: (i) selection of {RNA} sequences based on their secondary structure, (ii) generating a library of three-dimensional {(3D)} structures of {RNA} molecules and (iii) high-throughput virtual screening of this library to select aptamers with binding affinity to a desired small molecule. We developed a set of criteria that allows one to select a sequence with potential binding affinity from a pool of random sequences and developed a protocol for {RNA} {3D} structure prediction. As verification, we tested the performance of in silico selection on a set of six known aptamer-ligand complexes. The structures of the native sequences for the ligands in the testing set were among the top 5\% of the selected structures. The proposed approach reduces the {RNA} sequences search space by four to five orders of magnitude--significantly accelerating the experimental screening and selection of high-affinity aptamers.},

Here we demonstrate the existence of two alternative termination mechanisms that rescue polymerases failing to disengage from the template at {pA} sites. One of these fail-safe mechanisms is mediated by the {NRD} complex, similar to termination of short noncoding genes. The other termination mechanism is mediated by Rnt1 cleavage of the nascent transcript. Both fail-safe termination mechanisms trigger degradation of readthrough transcripts by the exosome. However, Rnt1-mediated termination can also enhance the usage of weak {pA} signals and thereby generate functional {mRNA.} We propose that these alternative Pol {II} termination pathways serve the dual function of avoiding transcription interference and promoting rapid removal of aberrant transcripts.},

By screening genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation {(ChIP)} profiles in yeast, we find that more than 10\% of {DNA-binding} transcription factors concentrate at the subtelomeric regions near to chromosome ends. None of the proteins identified were previously implicated in regulation at telomeres, yet genomic and proteomic studies reveal that a subset of factors show many interactions with established telomere binding complexes. For many factors, the subtelomeric binding pattern is dynamic and undergoes flux toward or away from the telomere as physiological conditions shift. We find that subtelomeric binding is dependent on environmental conditions and correlates with the induction of gene expression in response to stress. Taken together, these results underscore the importance of genome structure in understanding the regulatory dynamics of transcriptional networks.},

  abstract={The proteasome degrades proteins modified by polyubiquitylation, so correctly controlled ubiquitylation is crucial to avoid unscheduled proteolysis of essential proteins. The mechanism regulating proteolysis of {RNAPII} has been controversial since two distinct ubiquitin ligases {(E3s),} Rsp5 (and its human homologue {NEDD4)} and {Elongin-Cullin} complex, have both been shown to be required for its {DNA-damage-induced} polyubiquitylation. Here we show that these E3s work sequentially in a two-step mechanism. First, Rsp5 adds mono-ubiquitin, or sometimes a ubiquitin chain linked via ubiquitin lysine 63 that does not trigger proteolysis. When produced, the K63 chain can be trimmed to mono-ubiquitylation by an Rsp5-associated ubiquitin protease, Ubp2. Based on this mono-ubiquitin moiety on {RNAPII,} an {Elc1/Cul3} complex then produces a ubiquitin chain linked via lysine 48, which can trigger proteolysis. Likewise, for correct polyubiquitylation of human {RNAPII,} {NEDD4} cooperates with the {ElonginA/B/C-Cullin} 5 complex. These data indicate that {RNAPII} polyubiquitylation requires cooperation between distinct, sequentially acting ubiquitin ligases, and raise the intriguing possibility that other members of the large and functionally diverse family of {NEDD4-like} ubiquitin ligases also require the assistance of a second E3 when targeting proteins for degradation.},

To assess the level of functional redundancy between the paralogous Trf4 and Trf5 proteins and to investigate the role of the Trf4-dependent polyadenylation in vivo, we used {DNA} microarrays to compare gene expression of the wild-type yeast strain of S. cerevisiae with either that of {trf4Delta} or {trf5Delta} mutant strains or the {trf4Delta} mutant expressing the polyadenylation-defective {Trf4(DADA)} protein. We found little overlap between the sets of transcripts with altered expression in the {trf4Delta} or the {trf5Delta} mutants, suggesting that Trf4p and Trf5p target distinct groups of {RNAs} for degradation. Surprisingly, most {RNAs} the expression of which was altered by the trf4 deletion were restored to wild-type levels by overexpression of {TRF4(DADA),} showing that the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p is dispensable in vivo. Apart from previously reported Trf4p and Trf5p target {RNAs,} this analysis along with in vivo cross-linking and {RNA} immunopurification-chip experiments revealed that both the {TRAMP4} and the {TRAMP5} complexes stimulate the degradation of spliced-out introns via a mechanism that is independent of the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p. In addition, we show that disruption of trf4 causes severe shortening of telomeres suggesting that {TRF4} functions in the maintenance of telomere length. Finally, our study demonstrates that {TRF4,} the exosome, and {TRF5} participate in antisense {RNA-mediated} regulation of genes involved in phosphate metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that paralogous {TRAMP} complexes have distinct {RNA} selectivities with functional implications in {RNA} surveillance as well as other {RNA-related} processes.

The yeast Ctk1 kinase associates with elongation complexes and phosphorylates serine 2 in the {YSPTSPS} repeats of the Rpb1 C-terminal domain, a modification that couples transcription to {mRNA} 3'-end processing. The higher eukaryotic kinase Cdk9 not only performs a similar function, but also functions at the 5'-end of genes in the transition from initiation to elongation. In strains lacking Ctk1, many basal transcription factors cross-link throughout transcribed regions, apparently remaining associated with {RNApII} until it terminates. Consistent with this observation, preinitiation complexes formed on immobilized templates with transcription extracts lacking Ctk1 leave lower levels of the scaffold complex behind after escape. Taken together, these results suggest that Ctk1 is necessary for the release of {RNApII} from basal transcription factors. Interestingly, this function of Ctk1 is independent of its kinase activity, suggesting a structural function of the protein.},

  abstract={Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding {RNAs.} These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, {SUTs)} or are rapidly degraded by the {RNA} surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, {CUTs).} One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of {SUTs} and {CUTs} with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of {SUTs} and {CUTs} can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated {RNAs} or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including {SUTs} and {CUTs} has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both {SUTs} and {CUTs} display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from {NFRs} at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from {NFRs} associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.},

We sequenced {RNA} from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International {HapMap} Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the {HapMap} project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that {eQTLs} near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

  abstract={{tRNA} biology has come of age, revealing an unprecedented level of understanding and many unexpected discoveries along the way. This review highlights new findings on the diverse pathways of {tRNA} maturation, and on the formation and function of a number of modifications. Topics of special focus include the regulation of {tRNA} biosynthesis, quality control {tRNA} turnover mechanisms, widespread {tRNA} cleavage pathways activated in response to stress and other growth conditions, emerging evidence of signaling pathways involving {tRNA} and cleavage fragments, and the sophisticated intracellular {tRNA} trafficking that occurs during and after biosynthesis.},

  abstract={Until recently, it was generally assumed that essentially all regulation of transcription takes place via regions adjacent to the coding region of a gene--namely promoters and enhancers--and that, after recruitment to the promoter, the polymerase simply behaves like a machine, quickly "reading the gene." However, over the past decade a revolution in this thinking has occurred, culminating in the idea that transcript elongation is extremely complex and highly regulated and, moreover, that this process significantly affects both the organization and integrity of the genome. This review addresses basic aspects of transcript elongation by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} and how it relates to other {DNA-related} processes.},

  abstract={Termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} transcription of protein-coding genes occurs downstream of cleavage/polyadenylation sites. According to the "torpedo" model, the 5'-3' exonuclease {Rat1p/Xrn2p} attacks the newly formed 5' end of the cleaved {pre-mRNA,} causing the still transcribing {RNAPII} to terminate. Here we demonstrate a similar role of S. cerevisiae Rat1p within the gene body. We find that the transcription processivity defect imposed on {RNAPII} by the {rpb1-N488D} mutation is corrected upon Rat1p inactivation. Importantly, Rat1p-dependent transcription termination occurs upstream the polyadenylation site. Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that {mRNA} capping is defective in {rpb1-N488D} cells, which leads to increased levels of Rat1p all along the gene locus. Consistently, Rat1p-dependent {RNAPII} termination is also observed in the capping-deficient ceg1-63 strain. Our data suggest that Rat1p serves to terminate {RNAPII} molecules engaged in the production of uncapped {RNA,} regardless of their position on the gene locus.},

  abstract={Chromatin organization plays a major role in gene regulation and can affect the function and evolution of new transcriptional programs. However, it can be difficult to decipher the basis of changes in chromatin organization and their functional effect on gene expression. Here, we present a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the relationship between chromatin organization and gene expression, by measuring {mRNA} abundance and nucleosome positions genome-wide in 12 Hemiascomycota yeast species. We found substantial conservation of global and functional chromatin organization in all species, including prominent nucleosome-free regions {(NFRs)} at gene promoters, and distinct chromatin architecture in growth and stress genes. Chromatin organization has also substantially diverged in both global quantitative features, such as spacing between adjacent nucleosomes, and in functional groups of genes. Expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and trans-acting chromatin modifiers all play important, complementary, and evolvable roles in determining {NFRs.} We identify five mechanisms that couple chromatin organization to evolution of gene regulation and have contributed to the evolution of respiro-fermentation and other key systems, including (1) compensatory evolution of alternative modifiers associated with conserved chromatin organization, (2) a gradual transition from constitutive to trans-regulated {NFRs,} (3) a loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences accompanying changes in chromatin organization and gene expression, (4) re-positioning of motifs from {NFRs} to nucleosome-occluded regions, and (5) the expanded use of {NFRs} by paralogous activator-repressor pairs. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis of chromatin organization, and on the role of chromatin organization in the evolution of gene regulation.},

Although Prp16 does not promote splicing of a genuine substrate until after 5' splice site cleavage, we found that Prp16 can associate with spliceosomes before 5' splice site cleavage, consistent with a role for Prp16 in proofreading 5' splice site cleavage. We established that Prp16-mediated rejection is reversible, necessitating a downstream discard pathway that we found requires the {DEAH} box {ATPase} Prp43, a spliceosome disassembly factor.

  abstract={Transcription of eukaryotic messenger {RNA} {(mRNA)} encoding genes by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} is triggered by the binding of transactivating proteins to enhancer {DNA,} which stimulates the recruitment of general transcription factors {(TFIIA,} B, D, E, F, H) and Pol {II} on the cis-linked promoter, leading to pre-initiation complex formation and transcription. In {TFIID-dependent} activation pathways, this general transcription factor containing {TATA-box-binding} protein is first recruited on the promoter through interaction with activators and cooperates with {TFIIA} to form a committed pre-initiation complex. However, neither the mechanisms by which activation signals are communicated between these factors nor the structural organization of the activated pre-initiation complex are known. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the architecture of nucleoprotein complexes composed of {TFIID,} {TFIIA,} the transcriptional activator Rap1 and yeast enhancer-promoter {DNA.} These structures revealed the mode of binding of Rap1 and {TFIIA} to {TFIID,} as well as a reorganization of {TFIIA} induced by its interaction with Rap1. We propose that this change in position increases the exposure of {TATA-box-binding} protein within {TFIID,} consequently enhancing its ability to interact with the promoter. A large Rap1-dependent {DNA} loop forms between the activator-binding site and the proximal promoter region. This loop is topologically locked by a {TFIIA-Rap1} protein bridge that folds over the {DNA.} These results highlight the role of {TFIIA} in transcriptional activation, define a molecular mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication and provide structural insights into the pathways of intramolecular communication that convey transcription activation signals through the {TFIID} complex.},

This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, {RNA} polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced {mRNA} and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.},

The dimeric Reb1 protein catalyzes termination and mediates interaction between Ter sites. The Reb1-dependent interactions between two antiparallel Ter sites in cis caused looping out of the intervening {DNA} in vitro and enhancement of fork arrest in vivo. A Ter site on chromosome 2 interacted pairwise with two Ter sites located on chromosome 1 by chromosome kissing. Mutational inactivation of the major interacting Ter site on chromosome 1 significantly reduced fork arrest at the Ter site on chromosome 2, thereby revealing a cooperative mechanism of control of replication termination.},

We present a stochastic model for whole chromosome replication where the dynamics are based upon the parameters of individual origins. Using this model we demonstrate that mean replication time at any given chromosome position is determined collectively by the parameters of all origins. Combining parameter estimation with extensive simulations we show that there is a range of model parameters consistent with mean replication data, emphasising the need for caution in interpreting such data. In contrast, the replicated-fraction at time points through S phase contains more information than mean replication time data and allowed us to use our model to uniquely estimate many origin parameters. These estimated parameters enable us to make a number of predictions that showed agreement with independent experimental data, confirming that our model has predictive power. In summary, we demonstrate that a stochastic model can recapitulate experimental observations, including those that might be interpreted as deterministic such as ordered origin activation times.},

  abstract={{Pre-mRNA} splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which can assemble on {pre-mRNA} cotranscriptionally. However, whether splicing generally occurs during transcription has not been addressed. Indeed, splicing catalysis is expected to occur posttranscriptionally in yeast, where the shortness of terminal exons should leave insufficient time for splicing. Here, we isolate endogenous S. cerevisiae nascent {RNA} and determine gene-specific splicing efficiencies and transcription profiles, using high-density tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes. Analysis of transcription profiles reveals Pol {II} pausing within the terminal exons of these genes. Intronless and inefficiently spliced genes lack this pause. In silico simulations of transcription and splicing kinetics confirm that this pausing event provides sufficient time for splicing before termination. The discovery of terminal exon pausing demonstrates functional coupling of transcription and splicing near gene ends.},

  abstract={The amount of {mRNA} in a cell is the result of two opposite reactions: transcription and {mRNA} degradation. These reactions are governed by kinetics laws, and the most regulated step for many genes is the transcription rate. The transcription rate, which is assumed to be exercised mainly at the {RNA} polymerase recruitment level, can be calculated using the {RNA} polymerase densities determined either by run-on or immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the ideal model organism to generate a complete set of nascent transcription rates that will prove useful for many gene regulation studies. By combining genomic data from both the {GRO} {(Genomic} Run-on) and the {RNA} pol {ChIP-on-chip} methods we generated a new, more accurate nascent transcription rate dataset. By comparing this dataset with the indirect ones obtained from the {mRNA} stabilities and {mRNA} amount datasets, we are able to obtain biological information about posttranscriptional regulation processes and a genomic snapshot of the location of the active transcriptional machinery. We have obtained nascent transcription rates for 4,670 yeast genes. The median {RNA} polymerase {II} density in the genes is 0.078 molecules/kb, which corresponds to an average of 0.096 molecules/gene. Most genes have transcription rates of between 2 and 30 {mRNAs/hour} and less than 1\% of yeast genes have \&gt;1 {RNA} polymerase molecule/gene. Histone and ribosomal protein genes are the highest transcribed groups of genes and other than these exceptions the transcription of genes is an infrequent phenomenon in a yeast cell.},

  abstract={{RNA} polymerase {II} transcribes both coding and noncoding genes, and termination of these different classes of transcripts is facilitated by different sets of termination factors. {Pre-mRNAs} are terminated through a process that is coupled to the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, and noncoding {RNAs} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are terminated through a pathway directed by the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and the {RNA} helicase Sen1. We have used an in vivo cross-linking approach to map the binding sites of components of the yeast {non-poly(A)} termination pathway. We show here that Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 bind to a number of noncoding {RNAs} in an unexpected manner. Sen1 shows a preference for {H/ACA} over box {C/D} {snoRNAs.} Nrd1, which binds to {snoRNA} terminators, also binds to the upstream region of some {snoRNA} transcripts and to {snoRNAs} embedded in introns. We present results showing that several {RNAs,} including the telomerase {RNA} {TLC1,} require Nrd1 for proper processing. Binding of Nrd1 to transcripts from {tRNA} genes is another unexpected observation. We also observe {RNA} polymerase {II} binding to transcripts from {RNA} polymerase {III} genes, indicating a possible role for the Nrd1 pathway in surveillance of transcripts synthesized by the wrong polymerase. The binding targets of Nrd1 pathway components change in the absence of glucose, with Nrd1 and Nab3 showing a preference for binding to sites in the mature {snoRNA} and {tRNAs.} This suggests a novel role for Nrd1 and Nab3 in destruction of {ncRNAs} in response to nutrient limitation.},

  abstract={Non-coding {(nc)RNAs} are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability. Large {ncRNAs} interact with histone modifiers and are involved in cancer development, X-chromosome inactivation and autosomal gene imprinting. However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought, only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory {ncRNAs} are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' {RNA} exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory {ncRNA} family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq),} we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts {(XUTs)} in which 66\% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)-dependent.} The majority of {XUTs} strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, {RNAPII} chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by {DNA} sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of {RNAPII} occupancy over 273 genes with antisense {XUTs.} These genes show an unusual bias for {H3K4me3} marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing {H3K4me3} triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense {XUTs,} supporting a model in which {H3K4me3} antagonizes antisense {ncRNA} repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense {ncRNA-mediated} regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.},

Messenger {RNA} transcripts terminate downstream of the coding region in a process that is coupled to cleavage and polyadenylation reactions. Non-coding transcripts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae {snoRNAs} terminate in a process that requires the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1. We report here the transcriptome-wide distribution of these termination factors. These data sets derived from in vivo {protein-RNA} cross-linking provide high-resolution definition of {non-poly(A)} terminators, identify novel genes regulated by attenuation of nascent transcripts close to the promoter, and demonstrate the widespread occurrence of Nrd1-bound 3' antisense transcripts on genes that are poorly expressed. In addition, we show that Sen1 does not cross-link efficiently to many expected non-coding {RNAs} but does cross-link to the 3' end of most {pre-mRNA} transcripts, suggesting an extensive role in {mRNA} 3' end formation and/or termination.},

The helicase detects the number of 3'-terminal adenosines and, over several adenylation steps, elicits precisely tuned adjustments of {ATP} affinities and rate constants for adenylation and {TRAMP} dissociation.

We found that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Reb1 also upregulates transcription of the ste9(+) gene that is required for nitrogen-starvation-induced growth arrest with a G1 {DNA} content and sexual differentiation. Ste9 activates the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome {('APC/C')} in G1, targeting B-cyclin for proteasomal degradation in response to nutritional stress. Reb1 binds in vivo and in vitro to a specific {DNA} sequence at the promoter of ste9(+), similar to the sequence recognized in the {rDNA,} and this binding is required for ste9(+) transcriptional activation and G1 arrest. This suggests that Reb1 acts as a link between {rDNA} metabolism and cell cycle control in response to nutritional stress. In agreement with this new role for Reb1 in the regulation of the {G1-S} transition, reb1\&\#x394; and wee1(ts) mutations are synthetically lethal owing to the inability of these cells to lengthen G1 before entering S phase. Similarly, reb1\&\#x394; cdc10(ts) cells are unable to arrest in G1 and die at the semi-permissive temperature.},

We observed linearity between read density and {RNA} input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control {RNAs} to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to {GC} content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to {RNA} termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias.

Here we present the {1.6\&\#x2009;\&\#xC5;} structure of {Nab3-RRM} bound to its {UCUU} recognition sequence. The crystal structure reveals clear density for a {UCU} trinucleotide and a fourth putative U binding site. {Nab3-RRM} establishes a clear preference for the central cytidine of the {UCUU} motif, which forms pseudo-base pairing interactions primarily through hydrogen bonds to main chain atoms and one serine hydroxyl group. Specificity for the flanking uridines is less defined; however, binding experiments confirm that these residues are also important for high affinity binding. Comparison of the {Nab3-RRM} to other structures of {RRMs} bound to polypyrimidine {RNAs} showed that this mode of recognition is similar to what is observed for the polypyrimidine-tract binding {RRMs,} and that the serine residue involved in pseudo-base pairing is only found in {RRMs} that bind to polypyrimidine {RNAs} that contain a cytosine base, suggesting a possible mechanism for discriminating between cytosine and uracil bases in {RRMs} that bind to polypyrimidine-containing {RNA.}},

In the reactivation intermediate, {TFIIS} locks the trigger loop away from backtracked {RNA,} displaces {RNA} from the backtrack site, and complements the polymerase active site with a basic and two acidic residues that may catalyse proton transfers during {RNA} cleavage. The active site is demarcated from the backtrack site by a 'gating tyrosine' residue that probably delimits backtracking.

  abstract={Intron lariat {RNAs,} created by {pre-mRNA} splicing, are sources of information on gene expression and structure. Although produced equivalently to their corresponding {mRNAs,} the vast majority of intron lariat {RNAs} are rapidly degraded. However, their levels are enhanced in cells deficient for {RNA} debranching enzyme, which catalyzes linearization of these {RNAs,} the rate-limiting step in their degradation. Furthermore, {RNA} lariats are resistant to degradation by the 3' exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase {(PNPase),} providing a means to enrich for lariat {RNAs.} Working with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, our goal was to develop novel combinations of methods to enhance the use of intron lariat {RNAs} as objects of study. Using {RT-PCR} assays developed for detecting and quantifying specific lariat {RNAs,} we demonstrate the resistance of {RNA} lariats to degradation by {PNPase} and their sensitivity to cleavage by {RNA} debranching enzyme. We also employ sequential treatments with these two enzymes to produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs.} We establish the utility of the methods for analyzing {RNA} debranching enzyme variants and in vitro debranching reactions and discuss several possible applications, including measuring relative rates of transcription and combining these methods with non-gene-specific {RNA} sequencing as a novel approach for genome annotation. In summary, enzymatic treatments that produce characteristic effects on linear and lariat {RNAs,} combined with {RT-PCR} or {RNA} sequencing, can be powerful tools to advance studies on gene expression, alternative splicing, and any process that depends on the {RNA} debranching enzyme.},

The Nrd1 complex includes two {RNA-binding} proteins, the nuclear polyadenylated {RNA-binding} {(Nab)} 3 and the nuclear {pre-mRNA} down-regulation {(Nrd)} 1 that bind their specific termination elements. Here we report the solution structure of the {RNA-recognition} motif {(RRM)} of Nab3 in complex with a {UCUU} oligonucleotide, representing the Nab3 termination element. The structure shows that the first three nucleotides of {UCUU} are accommodated on the {\&\#x3B2;-sheet} surface of Nab3 {RRM,} but reveals a sequence-specific recognition only for the central cytidine and uridine. The specific contacts we identified are important for binding affinity in vitro as well as for yeast viability. Furthermore, we show that both {RNA-binding} motifs of Nab3 and Nrd1 alone bind their termination elements with a weak affinity. Interestingly, when Nab3 and Nrd1 form a heterodimer, the affinity to {RNA} is significantly increased due to the cooperative binding. These findings are in accordance with the model of their function in the {poly(A)} independent termination, in which binding to the combined and/or repetitive termination elements elicits efficient termination.},

  abstract={Genetic regulatory circuits are often regarded as precise machines that accurately determine the level of expression of each protein. Most experimental technologies used to measure gene expression levels are incapable of testing and challenging this notion, as they often measure levels averaged over entire populations of cells. Yet, when expression levels are measured at the single cell level of even genetically identical cells, substantial cell-to-cell variation (or "noise") may be observed. Sometimes different genes in a given genome may display different levels of noise; even the same gene, expressed under different environmental conditions, may display greater cell-to-cell variability in specific conditions and more tight control in other situations. While at first glance noise may seem to be an undesired property of biological networks, it might be beneficial in some cases. For instance, noise will increase functional heterogeneity in a population of microorganisms facing variable, often unpredictable, environmental changes, increasing the probability that some cells may survive the stress. In that respect, we can speculate that the population is implementing a risk distribution strategy, long before genetic heterogeneity could be acquired. Organisms may have evolved to regulate not only the averaged gene expression levels but also the extent of allowed deviations from such an average, setting it at the desired level for every gene under each specific condition. Here we review the evolving understanding of noise, its molecular underpinnings, and its effect on phenotype and fitness--when it can be detrimental, beneficial, or neutral and which regulatory tools eukaryotic cells may use to optimally control it.},

Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, {NET-seq),} based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with {RNA} polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of {NET-seq} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the {Rpd3S} deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

We propose a stochastic model of splicing kinetics that explains data obtained from high-resolution kinetic analyses of transcription, splicing and 3' end formation during induction of an intron-containing reporter gene in budding yeast. Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing. Model comparison is used to assess the alternative representations of reactions. Modelling also indicates the functional coupling of transcription and splicing, because both the rate of initiation of transcription and the probability that step one of splicing occurs co-transcriptionally are reduced, when the second step of splicing is abolished in a mutant reporter.},

It is not clear what factors determine the genome-wide pattern of binding or regulation for a given transcription factor. We used an integrated approach to study how trans influences shape the binding and regulatory landscape of Pho4, a budding yeast transcription factor activated in response to phosphate limitation. We find that nucleosomes significantly restrict Pho4 binding. At nucleosome-depleted sites, competition from another transcription factor, Cbf1, determines Pho4 occupancy, raising the threshold for transcriptional activation in phosphate replete conditions and preventing Pho4 activation of genes outside the phosphate regulon during phosphate starvation. Pho4 binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation-a cooperative interaction between Pho2 and Pho4 specifies genes that are activated. Combining these experimental observations, we are able to globally predict Pho4 binding and its functionality.},

Sequence read data from these nuclear run-on libraries revealed that transcriptional regulation in yeast occurs not only at the level of {RNA} polymerase recruitment to promoters but also at postrecruitment steps. Nascent synthesis signals are strongly enriched at {TSS} throughout the yeast genome, particularly at histone loci. Nascent transcripts reveal antisense transcription for more than 300 genes, with the read data providing support for the activity of distinct promoters driving transcription in opposite directions rather than bidirectional transcription from single promoters. By monitoring total {RNA} in parallel, we found that transcriptional activity accounts for 80\% of the variance in transcript abundance. We computed {RNA} stabilities from nascent and steady-state transcripts for each gene and found that the most stable and unstable transcripts encode proteins whose functional roles are consistent with these stabilities. We also surveyed transcriptional activity after heat shock and found that most, but not all, heat shock-inducible genes increase their abundance by increasing their {RNA} synthesis. In summary, this study provides a genome-wide view of {RNA} polymerase activity in yeast, identifies regulatory steps in the synthesis of transcripts, and analyzes transcript stabilities.},

Meiotic unannotated transcripts {(MUTs)} are mitotic targets of the conserved exosome component Rrp6, which itself is degraded after the onset of meiosis when {MUTs} and other {ncRNAs} accumulate in successive waves.

  abstract={The packaging of eukaryotic genomes into nuclesomes plays critical roles in chromatin organization and gene regulation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that nucleosome occupancy is partially encoded by intrinsic antinucleosomal {DNA} sequences, such as {poly(A)} sequences, as well as by binding sites for trans-acting factors that can evict nucleosomes, such as Reb1 and the Rsc3/30 complex. Here, we use genome-wide nucleosome occupancy maps in 13 Ascomycota fungi to discover large-scale evolutionary reprogramming of both intrinsic and trans determinants of chromatin structure. We find that {poly(G)s} act as intrinsic antinucleosomal sequences, comparable to the known function of {poly(A)s,} but that the abundance of {poly(G)s} has diverged greatly between species, obscuring their antinucleosomal effect in {low-poly(G)} species such as S. cerevisiae. We also develop a computational method that uses nucleosome occupancy maps for discovering trans-acting general regulatory factor {(GRF)} binding sites. Our approach reveals that the specific sequences bound by {GRFs} have diverged substantially across evolution, corresponding to a number of major evolutionary transitions in the repertoire of {GRFs.} We experimentally validate a proposed evolutionary transition from Cbf1 as a major {GRF} in pre-whole-genome duplication {(WGD)} yeasts to Reb1 in {post-WGD} yeasts. We further show that the mating type switch-activating protein Sap1 is a {GRF} in S. pombe, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. Our results reveal that the underlying mechanisms that determine in vivo chromatin organization have diverged and that comparative genomics can help discover new determinants of chromatin organization.},

This is the same processing pathway used by yeast {snoRNAs.} Whereas {CUTs} are only easily observed in cells lacking the Rrp6 or Rrp47 subunits of the nuclear exosome, Stable Uncharacterized Transcripts {(SUTs)} are present even in wild-type cells. Here we show that {SUTs} are partially susceptible to the nuclear exosome, but are primarily degraded by cytoplasmic 5' to 3' degradation and nonsense-mediated decay {(NMD).} Therefore, {SUTs} may be processed similarly to {mRNAs.} Surprisingly, both {CUTs} and {SUTs} were found to produce 3' extended species that were also subject to cytoplasmic degradation. The functions, if any, of these extended {CUTs} and {SUTs} are unknown, but their discovery suggests that yeasts generate transcripts reminiscent of long non-coding {RNAs} found in higher eukaryotes.},

  abstract={Gene transcription is highly regulated. Altered transcription can lead to cancer or developmental diseases. Mediator, a multisubunit complex conserved among eukaryotes, is generally required for {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} transcription. An interaction between the two complexes is known, but its molecular nature and physiological role are unclear. We identify a direct physical interaction between the Rpb3 Pol {II} subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the essential Mediator subunit, Med17. Furthermore, we demonstrate a functional element in the {Mediator-Pol} {II} interface that is important for genome-wide Pol {II} recruitment in vivo. Our findings suggest that a direct interaction between Mediator and Pol {II} is generally required for transcription of class {II} genes in eukaryotes.},

  abstract={Recent studies on yeast transcriptome have revealed the presence of a large set of {RNA} polymerase {II} transcripts mapping to intergenic and antisense regions or overlapping canonical genes. Most of these {ncRNAs} {(ncRNAs)} are subject to termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs).} {CUTs} are often considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression. Regulatory mechanisms involving expression of a {CUT} are diverse and include attenuation, transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice. This review focuses on the impact of cryptic transcription on gene expression, describes the role of the Nrd1-complex as the main actor in preventing nonfunctional and potentially harmful transcription, and details a few systems where expression of a {CUT} has an essential regulatory function. We also summarize the most recent studies concerning other types of {ncRNAs} and their possible role in regulation.},

  abstract={The unique C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNA} polymerase {II,} composed of tandem heptad repeats of the consensus sequence {YSPTSPS,} is subject to differential phosphorylation throughout the transcription cycle. Several {RNA} processing factors have been shown to bind the phosphorylated {CTD} and use it to localize to nascent {pre-mRNA} during transcription. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {mRNA} export protein Yra1 {(ALY/RNA} export factor in metazoa) cotranscriptionally associates with {mRNA} and delivers it to the nuclear pore complex for export to the cytoplasm. Here we report that Yra1 directly binds in vitro the hyperphosphorylated form of the {CTD} characteristic of elongating {RNA} polymerase {II} and contains a {phospho-CTD-interacting} domain within amino acids 18-184, which also include an {"RNA} recognition motif" {(RRM)} (residues 77-184). Using {UV} cross-linking, we showed that the {RRM} alone binds {RNA,} although a larger segment extending to the C terminus (amino acids 77-226) displayed stronger {RNA} binding activity. Although the {RRM} is implicated in both {RNA} and {CTD} binding, {RRM} point mutations separated these two functions. Both functions are important in vivo as {RNA} binding-defective or {CTD} binding-defective versions of Yra1 engendered growth and {mRNA} export defects. We also report the construction and characterization of a useful new temperature-sensitive {YRA1} allele {(R107A/F126A).} Using {ChIP,} we demonstrated that removing the N-terminal 76 amino acids of Yra1 (all of the {phospho-CTD-interacting} domain up to the {RRM)} results in a 10-fold decrease in Yra1 recruitment to genes during elongation. These results indicate that the {phospho-CTD} is likely involved directly in the cotranscriptional recruitment of Yra1.},

  abstract={Coordinate regulation of ribosomal protein {(RP)} genes is key for controlling cell growth. In yeast, it is unclear how this regulation achieves the required equimolar amounts of the different {RP} components, given that some {RP} genes exist in duplicate copies, while others have only one copy. Here, we tested whether the solution to this challenge is partly encoded within the {DNA} sequence of the {RP} promoters, by fusing 110 different {RP} promoters to a fluorescent gene reporter, allowing us to robustly detect differences in their promoter activities that are as small as \{\textasciitilde\}10\%. We found that single-copy {RP} promoters have significantly higher activities, suggesting that proper {RP} stoichiometry is indeed partly encoded within the {RP} promoters. Notably, we also partially uncovered how this regulation is encoded by finding that {RP} promoters with higher activity have more nucleosome-disfavoring sequences and characteristic spatial organizations of these sequences and of binding sites for key {RP} regulators. Mutations in these elements result in a significant decrease of {RP} promoter activity. Thus, our results suggest that intrinsic {(DNA-dependent)} nucleosome organization may be a key mechanism by which genomes encode biologically meaningful promoter activities. Our approach can readily be applied to uncover how transcriptional programs of other promoters are encoded.},

The {ATPases} of this family are encoded by 27 human genes and are usually associated with several other proteins that are stable, non-exchangeable subunits. One fundamental mechanism used by these complexes is thought to be the movement or exchange of nucleosomes to regulate transcription. However, recent genetic studies indicate that chromatin remodelers may also be involved in regulating other aspects of chromatin structure during many cellular processes. The {SWI/SNF} family in particular appears to have undergone a substantial change in subunit composition and mechanism coincident with the evolutionary advent of multicellularity and the appearance of linking histones. The differential usage of this greater diversity of mammalian {BAF} subunits is essential for the development of specific cell fates, including the progression from pluripotency to multipotency to committed neurons. Recent human genetic screens have revealed that {BRG1,} {ARID1A,} {BAF155,} and {hSNF5} are frequently mutated in tumors, indicating that {BAF} complexes also play a critical role in the initiation or progression of cancer. The mechanistic bases underlying the genetic requirements for {BAF} and other chromatin remodelers in development and cancer are relatively unexplored and will be a focus of this review.},

However, these in vivo observations are inconsistent with in vitro evidence for left-handed octameric {CenH3} nucleosomes. To help resolve these inconsistencies, we characterized yeast centromeric chromatin at single base-pair resolution. Intact particles containing both Cse4 and {H2A} are precisely protected from micrococcal nuclease over the entire {CDE} of all 16 yeast centromeres in both solubilized chromatin and the insoluble kinetochore. Small {DNA-binding} proteins protect {CDEI} and {CDEIII} and delimit the centromeric nucleosome to the {\&\#x223C;80-bp} {CDEII,} only enough for a single {DNA} wrap. As expected for a tripartite organization of centromeric chromatin, loss of Cbf1 protein, which binds to {CDEI,} both reduces the size of the centromere-protected region and shifts its location toward {CDEIII.} Surprisingly, Cse4 overproduction caused genome-wide misincorporation of nonfunctional {CenH3-containing} nucleosomes that protect {\&\#x223C;135} base pairs and are preferentially enriched at sites of high nucleosome turnover. Our detection of two forms of {CenH3} nucleosomes in the yeast genome, a singly wrapped particle at the functional centromere and octamer-sized particles on chromosome arms, reconcile seemingly conflicting in vivo and in vitro observations.},

Productive transcription requires the escape of the paused {RNAPII} from the promoter and transition to rapid elongation of the transcript. Numerous studies have identified diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter. The general theme that has emerged is that the balance between positive and negative regulatory factors determines the overall rate of transcription. Recently transcription termination has emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation that is coupled with the efficient recycling of {RNAPII.} The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation.

We report the identification of new {mRNA} targets of the {Nrd1-Nab3} pathway that are rapidly repressed in response to glucose depletion. Glucose depletion also leads to the dephosphorylation of Nrd1 and the formation of novel nuclear speckles that contain Nrd1 and Nab3.

  abstract={Silencing at the {HMR} and {HML} loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires recruitment of Sir proteins to the {HML} and {HMR} silencers. The silencers are regulatory sites flanking both loci and consisting of binding sites for the Rap1, Abf1, and {ORC} proteins, each of which also functions at hundreds of sites throughout the genome in processes unrelated to silencing. Interestingly, the sequence of the binding site for Rap1 at the silencers is distinct from the genome-wide binding profile of Rap1, being a weaker match to the consensus, and indeed is bound with low affinity relative to the consensus sequence. Remarkably, this low-affinity Rap1 binding site variant was conserved among silencers of the sensu stricto Saccharomyces species, maintained as a poor match to the Rap1 genome-wide consensus sequence in all of them. We tested multiple predictions about the possible role of this binding-site variant in silencing by substituting the native Rap1 binding site at the {HMR-E} silencer with the genome-wide consensus sequence for Rap1. Contrary to the predictions from the current models of Rap1, we found no influence of the Rap1 binding site version on the kinetics of establishing silencing, nor on the maintenance of silencing, nor the extent of silencing. We further explored implications of these findings with regard to prevention of ectopic silencing, and deduced that the selective pressure for the unprecedented conservation of this binding site variant may not be related to silencing.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotes initiates at specific sites known as origins of replication, or replicators. These replication origins occur throughout the genome, though the propensity of their occurrence depends on the type of organism. In eukaryotes, zones of initiation of replication spanning from about 100 to 50,000 base pairs have been reported. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where some autonomously replicating sequences, or {ARS} elements, confer origin activity. {ARS} elements are short {DNA} sequences of a few hundred base pairs, identified by their efficiency at initiating a replication event when cloned in a plasmid. {ARS} elements, although structurally diverse, maintain a basic structure composed of three domains, A, B and C. Domain A is comprised of a consensus sequence designated {ACS} {(ARS} consensus sequence), while the B domain has the {DNA} unwinding element and the C domain is important for {DNA-protein} interactions. Although there are {\&\#x223C;400\&\#xA0;ARS} elements in the yeast genome, not all of them are active origins of replication. Different groups within the genus Saccharomyces have {ARS} elements as components of replication origin. The present paper provides a comprehensive review of various aspects of {ARSs,} starting from their structural conservation to sequence thermodynamics. All significant and conserved functional sequence motifs within different types of {ARS} elements have been extensively described. Issues like silencing at {ARSs,} their inherent fragility and factors governing their replication efficiency have also been addressed. Progress in understanding crucial components associated with the replication machinery and timing at these {ARS} elements is discussed in the section entitled {"The} replicon revisited".},

The extent of divergence differs greatly between genes and is correlated to promoter nucleosome organization. We hypothesized that this may be partially explained by differential sensitivity of expression to mutations in the promoter region. We measured the sensitivity of 22 yeast promoters with varying nucleosome patterns to random mutations in sequence. Mutation sensitivity differed by up to 10-fold between promoters. This difference could not be explained by the abundance of transcription factor binding sites. Rather, mutation sensitivity positively correlated with the relative occupancy of nucleosomes at the proximal promoter region. Furthermore, mutation sensitivity was reduced upon introduction of a binding site for Reb1, a factor that blocks nucleosome formation, suggesting that nucleosome organization directly regulates mutation sensitivity. Our study suggests an important role for chromatin structure in the evolution of gene expression.},

Repression was not Ty1 specific; when introduced immediately downstream of the green fluorescent protein {(GFP)} stop codon, {GFP} expression was similarly reduced. Rap1p mediated this down-regulation, as shown by mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation. A regular threefold drop is observed in different contexts, suggesting utility for synthetic circuits. A large reduction of {RNAP} {II} occupancy on the {CO-Ty1} construct was observed 3' to the identified Rap1p site and a novel 3' truncated {RNA} species was observed.

  abstract={In the gene expression field, different steps have been traditionally viewed as discrete and unconnected events. Nowadays, genetic and functional studies support the model of a coupled network of physical and functional connections to carry out {mRNA} biogenesis. Gene expression is a coordinated process that comprises different linked steps like transcription, {RNA} processing, export to the cytoplasm, translation and degradation of {mRNAs.} Its regulation is essential for cellular survival and can occur at many different levels. Transcription is the central function that occurs in the nucleus, and {RNAPII} plays an essential role in {mRNA} biogenesis. During transcription, nascent {mRNA} is associated with the {mRNA-binding} proteins involved in processing and export of the {mRNA} particle. Cells have developed a network of multi-protein complexes whose functions regulate the different factors involved both temporally and spatially. This coupling mechanism acts as a quality control to solve some of the organization problems of gene expression in vivo, where all the factors implicated ensure that {mRNAs} are ready to be exported and translated. In this review, we focus on the functional coupling of gene transcription and {mRNA} export, and place particular emphasis on the relationship between the {NPC-associated} complex, {TREX2,} and the transcription co-activator, {SAGA.} We have pinpointed the experimental evidence for Sus1's roles in transcription initiation, transcription elongation and {mRNA} export. In addition, we have reviewed other {NPC-related} processes such as gene gating to the nuclear envelope, the chromatin structure and the cellular context in which these processes take place.

Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis.

  abstract={The Saccharomyces cerevisiae {SEN1} gene codes for a nuclear, {ATP-dependent} helicase which is embedded in a complex network of protein-protein interactions. Pleiotropic phenotypes of mutations in {SEN1} suggest that Sen1 functions in many nuclear processes, including transcription termination, {DNA} repair, and {RNA} processing. Sen1, along with termination factors Nrd1 and Nab3, is required for the termination of noncoding {RNA} transcripts, but Sen1 is associated during transcription with coding and noncoding genes. Sen1 and Nrd1 both interact directly with Nab3, as well as with the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of Rpb1, the largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II.} It has been proposed that Sen1, Nab3, and Nrd1 form a complex that associates with Rpb1 through an interaction between Nrd1 and the Ser5-phosphorylated {(Ser5-P)} {CTD.} To further study the relationship between the termination factors and Rpb1, we used two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation to characterize {sen1-R302W,} a mutation that impairs an interaction between Sen1 and the Ser2-phosphorylated {CTD.} Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that the impairment of the interaction between Sen1 and {Ser2-P} causes the reduced occupancy of mutant Sen1 across the entire length of noncoding genes. For protein-coding genes, mutant Sen1 occupancy is reduced early and late in transcription but is similar to that of the wild type across most of the coding region. The combined data suggest a handoff model in which proteins differentially transfer from the Ser5- to the Ser2-phosphorylated {CTD} to promote the termination of noncoding transcripts or other cotranscriptional events for protein-coding genes.},

We generated a homogeneous set of several hundreds of artificial, {NNS-dependent} terminators with an in vivo selection approach. Analysis of these terminators revealed novel and extended sequence determinants for transcription termination and {NNS} complex binding as well as supermotifs that are critical for termination. Biochemical and structural data revealed that affinity and specificity of {RNA} recognition by Nab3p relies on induced fit recognition implicating an {\&\#x3B1;-helical} extension of the {RNA} recognition motif. Interestingly, the same motifs can be recognized by the {NNS} or the {mRNA} termination complex depending on their position relative to the start of transcription, suggesting that they function as general transcriptional insulators to prevent interference between the non-coding and the coding yeast transcriptomes.},

At {TATA-box-containing} promoters, which are depleted of {TFIID,} a +1 nucleosome was positioned to be in competition with the {PIC,} which may allow greater latitude in start-site selection. Our genomic localization of messenger {RNA} and non-coding {RNA} {PICs} reveals that two {PICs,} in inverted orientation, may occupy the flanking borders of nucleosome-free regions.

  abstract={Transcriptomic analyses have identified tens of thousands of intergenic, intronic, and cis-antisense long noncoding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} that are expressed from mammalian genomes. Despite progress in functional characterization, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of {lncRNAs} and their half-lives. Although many are easily detectable by a variety of techniques, it has been assumed that {lncRNAs} are generally unstable, but this has not been examined genome-wide. Utilizing a custom noncoding {RNA} array, we determined the half-lives of {\&\#x223C;800} {lncRNAs} and {\&\#x223C;12,000} {mRNAs} in the mouse Neuro-2a cell line. We find only a minority of {lncRNAs} are unstable. {LncRNA} half-lives vary over a wide range, comparable to, although on average less than, that of {mRNAs,} suggestive of complex metabolism and widespread functionality. Combining half-lives with comprehensive {lncRNA} annotations identified hundreds of unstable (half-life \&lt; 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic {lncRNAs,} as well as {lncRNAs} showing extreme stability (half-life \&gt; 16 h). Analysis of {lncRNA} features revealed that intergenic and cis-antisense {RNAs} are more stable than those derived from introns, as are spliced {lncRNAs} compared to unspliced (single exon) transcripts. Subcellular localization of {lncRNAs} indicated widespread trafficking to different cellular locations, with nuclear-localized {lncRNAs} more likely to be unstable. Surprisingly, one of the least stable {lncRNAs} is the well-characterized paraspeckle {RNA} Neat1, suggesting Neat1 instability contributes to the dynamic nature of this subnuclear domain. We have created an online interactive resource (http://stability.matticklab.com) that allows easy navigation of {lncRNA} and {mRNA} stability profiles and provides a comprehensive annotation of \{\textasciitilde\}7200 mouse {lncRNAs.}},

  abstract={The largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II,} Rpb1, contains an unusual C-terminal domain {(CTD)} composed of numerous repeats of the {YSPTSPS} consensus sequence. This sequence is the target of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation and transitions between stereoisomeric states, resulting in a vast combinatorial potential referred to as the {CTD} code. In order to gain insight into the biological significance of this code, several studies recently reported the genome-wide distribution of some of these modified polymerases and associated factors in either fission yeast {(Schizosaccharomyces} pombe) or budding yeast {(Saccharomyces} cerevisiae). The resulting occupancy maps reveal that a general {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription complex exists and undergoes uniform transitions from initiation to elongation to termination. Nevertheless, {CTD} phosphorylation dynamics result in a gene-specific effect on {mRNA} expression. In this review, we focus on the gene-specific requirement of {CTD} phosphorylation and discuss in more detail the case of serine 2 phosphorylation {(S2P)} within the {CTD,} a modification that is dispensable for general transcription in fission yeast but strongly affects transcription reprogramming and cell differentiation in response to environmental cues. The recent discovery of Cdk12 as a genuine {CTD} S2 kinase and its requirement for gene-specific expression are discussed in the wider context of metazoa.},

We analyzed the transcriptome of combinations of Rrp6p and Dis3p catalytic mutants by high-resolution tiling arrays. We show that Dis3p and Rrp6p have both overlapping and specific roles in degrading distinct classes of substrates. We found that transcripts derived from more than half of intron-containing genes are degraded before splicing. Surprisingly, we also show that the exosome degrades large amounts of {tRNA} precursors despite the absence of processing defects. These results underscore the notion that large amounts of {RNAs} produced in wild-type cells are discarded before entering functional pathways and suggest that kinetic competition with degradation proofreads the efficiency and accuracy of processing.},

  abstract={A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA-Seq} gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods {(GLMs)} to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA-Seq} applications, including {ChIP-Seq} for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

We characterize the relationship between motif variants and gene expression by analyzing expression microarray data and binding site predictions. To accomplish this, we statistically detect motif variants with effects that differ among environments. Such environmental specificity may be due to either affinity differences between variants or, more likely, differential interactions of {TFs} bound to these variants with cofactors, and with differential presence of cofactors across environments. We examine conservation of functional variants across four Saccharomyces species, and find that about a third of transcription factors have target genes that are differentially expressed in a condition-specific manner that is correlated with the nucleotide at variant motif positions. We find good correspondence between our results and some cases in the experimental literature {(Reb1,} Sum1, Mcm1, and Rap1). These results and growing consensus in the literature indicates that motif variants may often be functionally distinct, that this may be observed in genomic data, and that variants play an important role in condition-specific gene regulation.},

  abstract={The {RNA} component of budding yeast telomerase {(Tlc1)} occurs in two forms, a non-polyadenylated form found in functional telomerase and a rare polyadenylated version with unknown function. Previous work suggested that the functional Tlc1 {polyA-} {RNA} is processed from the {polyA+} form, but the mechanisms regulating its transcription termination and 3'-end formation remained unclear. Here we examined transcription termination of Tlc1 {RNA} in the sequences 3' of the {TLC1} gene and relate it to telomere maintenance. Strikingly, disruption of all probable or cryptic polyadenylation signals near the 3'-end blocked the accumulation of the previously reported {polyA+} {RNA} without affecting the level, function or specific 3' nucleotide of the mature {polyA-} form. A genetic approach analysing {TLC1} 3'-end sequences revealed that transcription terminates upstream of the polyadenylation sites. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the function of this Tlc1 terminator depends on the {Nrd1/Nab3} transcription termination pathway. The data thus show that transcription termination of the budding yeast telomerase {RNA} occurs as that of {snRNAs} and Tlc1 functions in telomere maintenance are not strictly dependent on a polyadenylated precursor, even if the {polyA+} form can serve as intermediate in a redundant termination/maturation pathway.},

  abstract={The yeast {IMD2} gene encodes an enzyme involved in {GTP} synthesis. Its expression is controlled by guanine nucleotides through a set of alternate start sites and an intervening transcriptional terminator. In the off state, transcription results in a short non-coding {RNA} that starts upstream of the gene. Transcription terminates via the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} complex and is degraded by the nuclear exosome. Using a sensitive terminator read-through assay, we identified trans-acting Terminator Override {(TOV)} genes that operate this terminator. Four genes were identified: the {RNA} polymerase {II} phosphatase {SSU72,} the {RNA} polymerase {II} binding protein {PCF11,} the {TRAMP} subunit {TRF4} and the {hnRNP-like,} {NAB3.} The {TOV} phenotype can be explained by the loss of function of these gene products as described in models in which termination and {RNA} degradation are coupled to the phosphorylation state of {RNA} polymerase {II's} repeat domain. The most interesting mutations were those found in {NAB3,} which led to the finding that the removal of merely three carboxy-terminal amino acids compromised Nab3's function. This region of previously unknown function is distant from the protein's well-known {RNA} binding and Nrd1 binding domains. Structural homology modeling suggests this Nab3 'tail' forms an {\&\#x3B1;-helical} multimerization domain that helps assemble it onto an {RNA} substrate.},

The domain is structurally homologous to {hnRNP-C} from higher organisms. Here we provide biochemical evidence that this short region is sufficient to enable self-assembly of Nab3 into a tetrameric form in a manner similar to the cognate region of human {hnRNP-C.} Within this region, there is a stretch of low complexity protein sequence (16 glutamines) adjacent to a putative {\&\#x3B1;-helix} that potentiates the ability of the conserved region to self-assemble. The glutamine stretch and the final 18 amino acids of Nab3 are both important for termination in living yeast cells. The findings herein describe an additional avenue by which these {hnRNP-like} proteins can polymerize on target transcripts. This process is independent of, but acts in concert with, the interactions of the proteins with {RNA} and {RNA} polymerase and extends the relationship of Nab3 as a functional orthologue of a higher eukaryotic {hnRNP.}},

In eukaryotes, {tRNA} biosynthesis employs a specialized {RNA} polymerase that generates initial transcripts that must be subsequently altered via a multitude of post-transcriptional steps before the {tRNAs} beome mature molecules that function in protein synthesis. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches possible in the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae system have led to exciting advances in our understandings of {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing as well as to novel insights into {tRNA} turnover and {tRNA} subcellular dynamics. {tRNA} processing steps include removal of transcribed leader and trailer sequences, addition of {CCA} to the 3' mature sequence and, for {tRNA(His),} addition of a 5' G. About 20\% of yeast {tRNAs} are encoded by intron-containing genes. The three-step splicing process to remove the introns surprisingly occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast and each of the splicing enzymes appears to moonlight in functions in addition to {tRNA} splicing. There are 25 different nucleoside modifications that are added post-transcriptionally, creating {tRNAs} in which {\&\#x223C;15\%} of the residues are nucleosides other than A, G, U, or C. These modified nucleosides serve numerous important functions including {tRNA} discrimination, translation fidelity, and {tRNA} quality control. Mature {tRNAs} are very stable, but nevertheless yeast cells possess multiple pathways to degrade inappropriately processed or folded {tRNAs.} Mature {tRNAs} are also dynamic in cells, moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back again to the cytoplasm; the mechanism and function of this retrograde process is poorly understood. Here, the state of knowledge for {tRNA} post-transcriptional processing, turnover, and subcellular dynamics is addressed, highlighting the questions that remain.},

This enzyme, in conjunction with {PAH1-encoded} phosphatidate phosphatase, controls the levels of phosphatidate and diacylglycerol for phospholipid synthesis, membrane growth, and lipid droplet formation. In this work, we showed that a functional level of diacylglycerol kinase is regulated by the Reb1p transcription factor. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, purified recombinant Reb1p was shown to specifically bind its consensus recognition sequence {(CGGGTAA,} -166 to -160) in the {DGK1} promoter. Analysis of cells expressing the {PDGK1-lacZ} reporter gene showed that mutations {(GT\&\#x2192;TG)} in the Reb1p-binding sequence caused an 8.6-fold reduction in {\&\#x3B2;-galactosidase} activity. The expression of {DGK1(reb1),} a {DGK1} allele containing the Reb1p-binding site mutation, was greatly lower than that of the wild type allele, as indicated by analyses of {DGK1} {mRNA,} Dgk1p, and diacylglycerol kinase activity. In the presence of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis, the dgk1\&\#x394; mutant expressing {DGK1(reb1)} exhibited a significant defect in growth as well as in the synthesis of phospholipids from triacylglycerol mobilization. Unlike {DGK1,} the {DGK1(reb1)} expressed in the dgk1\&\#x394; pah1\&\#x394; mutant did not result in the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, which occurs in cells lacking phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the Reb1p-mediated regulation of diacylglycerol kinase plays a major role in its in vivo functions in lipid metabolism.},

In this review, we discuss recent advances shedding new light on how this complex process is regulated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The picture that emerges from these studies is that replication timing is regulated in cis by mechanisms modulating the chromatin structure and the subnuclear organization of origins.

In this study, mutants of the different termination pathways were compared by genome-wide expression analysis. Surprisingly, the expression changes observed upon loss of the {CTD-Ser2} kinase Ctk1p are more similar to those derived from alterations in the {Ser5P-dependent} {NNS} pathway, than from loss of {CTD-Ser2P} binding factors. Tiling array analysis of ctk1\&\#x394; cells reveals readthrough at {snoRNAs,} at many cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs)} and stable uncharacterized transcripts {(SUTs),} but only at some {mRNAs.} Despite the suggested predominant role in termination of {mRNAs,} we observed that a {CTK1} deletion or a Pol {II} {CTD} mutant lacking all Ser2 positions does not result in a global {mRNA} termination defect. Rather, termination defects in these strains are widely observed at {NNS-dependent} genes.

  abstract={The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit assembly that appears to be required for regulating expression of most {RNA} polymerase {II} (pol {II)} transcripts, which include protein-coding and most non-coding {RNA} genes. Mediator and pol {II} function within the pre-initiation complex {(PIC),} which consists of Mediator, pol {II,} {TFIIA,} {TFIIB,} {TFIID,} {TFIIE,} {TFIIF} and {TFIIH} and is approximately 4.0 {MDa} in size. Mediator serves as a central scaffold within the {PIC} and helps regulate pol {II} activity in ways that remain poorly understood. Mediator is also generally targeted by sequence-specific, {DNA-binding} transcription factors {(TFs)} that work to control gene expression programs in response to developmental or environmental cues. At a basic level, Mediator functions by relaying signals from {TFs} directly to the pol {II} enzyme, thereby facilitating {TF-dependent} regulation of gene expression. Thus, Mediator is essential for converting biological inputs (communicated by {TFs)} to physiological responses (via changes in gene expression). In this review, we summarize an expansive body of research on the Mediator complex, with an emphasis on yeast and mammalian complexes. We focus on the basics that underlie Mediator function, such as its structure and subunit composition, and describe its broad regulatory influence on gene expression, ranging from chromatin architecture to transcription initiation and elongation, to {mRNA} processing. We also describe factors that influence Mediator structure and activity, including {TFs,} non-coding {RNAs} and the {CDK8} module.},

  abstract={The genes encoding the ribosomal proteins of fungi form a regulon whose expression is enhanced under good growth conditions and down-regulated under starvation conditions. The fungal pathogen Candida albicans contains an evolutionarily ancient control circuit for this regulon where a heteromer made up of the transcription regulators Ifh1 (interacts with Forkhead 1) and Fhl1 {(Forkhead-like} 1) is targeted to the ribosomal protein genes by the {DNA} binding factor Tbf1. In the more recently evolved circuit in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {(Sc),} the generalist repressor-activator protein Rap1 now directs the {Ifh1-Fhl1} module to the ribosomal protein genes. Even though overall sequence similarity is low for the respective Fhl1 and Ifh1 subunits, in both species, the Ifh1 protein links to the Forkhead-associated domain of Fhl1 through its {FHB} domain. Intriguingly, correlated with the transition to the Rap1-regulated circuit, the {Sc-Ifh1} contains a Rap1 binding domain that is not present in the C. albicans protein. Because no extensive common sequences are found in Tbf1 and Rap1, it appears that these targeting proteins must connect to the {Ifh1-Fhl1} module in distinct ways. Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis has been used to show that in C. albicans Tbf1 is linked to the heterodimer through direct association with Fhl1. By contrast, in S. cerevisiae, the linkage of the heteromer to Rap1 occurs through Ifh1. Thus, in the ascomycetes, the {Ifh1-Fhl1} heterodimer has reconfigured its protein associations to remain connected to the ribosomal protein regulon despite rewiring of the targeting transcription factor from Tbf1 to Rap1.},

Here, we identified several base content and k-mer sequence features of the yeast core promoter sequence that are highly predictive of maximal promoter activity. These features are mainly located in the region 75 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the main transcription start site, and their associations hold for both constitutively active promoters and promoters that are induced or repressed in specific conditions. Our results unravel several architectural features of yeast core promoters and suggest that the yeast core promoter sequence downstream of the {TATA} box (or of similar sequences involved in recruitment of the pre-initiation complex) is a major determinant of maximal promoter activity. We further show that human core promoters also contain features that are indicative of maximal promoter activity; thus, our results emphasize the important role of the core promoter sequence in transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract={The replication of genomic {DNA} is limited to a single round per cell cycle. The first component, which recognises and remains bound to origins from recognition until activation and replication elongation, is the origin recognition complex. How origin recognition complex {(ORC)} proteins remain associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle is not yet completely understood. Several genome-wide studies have undoubtedly demonstrated that {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP-II)} binding sites overlap with replication origins and with the binding sites of the replication components. {RNAP-II} is no longer merely associated with transcription elongation. Several reports have demonstrated that {RNAP-II} molecules affect chromatin structure, transcription, {mRNA} processing, recombination and {DNA} repair, among others. Most of these activities have been reported to directly depend on the interaction of proteins with the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNAP-II.} Two-dimensional gels results and {ChIP} analysis presented herein suggest that stalled {RNAP-II} molecules bound to the {rDNA} chromatin participate in the anchoring of {ORC} proteins to origins during the G1 and S-phases. The results show that in the absence of {RNAP-II,} Orc1p, Orc2p and Cdc6p do not bind to origins. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that {Ser2P-CTD} and hypophosphorylated {RNAP-II} interact with Orc1p. In the context of {rDNA,} cryptic transcription by {RNAP-II} did not negatively interfere with {DNA} replication. However, the results indicate that {RNAP-II} is not necessary to maintain the binding of {ORCs} to the origins during metaphase. These findings highlight for the first time the potential importance of stalled {RNAP-II} in the regulation of {DNA} replication.},

  abstract={Biological processes are not exempt from errors and {RNA} production is not an exception to this rule. Errors can arise stochastically or be genetically fixed and systematically appear in the biochemical or cellular phenotype. In any case, quality control mechanisms are essential to minimize the potentially toxic effects of faulty {RNA} production or processing. Although many {RNA} molecules express their functional potential in the cytoplasm, as messengers, adaptors or operators of gene expression pathways, a large share of quality control occurs in the nucleus. This is likely because the early timing of occurrence and the subcellular partition make the control more efficient, at least as long as the defects can be detected ahead of the cytoplasmic phase of the {RNA} life cycle. One crucial point in discussing {RNA} quality control resides in its definition. A stringent take would imply the existence of specific mechanisms to recognize the error and the consequent repair or elimination of the faulty molecule. One example in the {RNA} field could be the recognition of a premature stop codon by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, discussed elsewhere in this issue. A more relaxed view posits that the thermodynamic or kinetic aftermath of a mistake (e.g. a blockage or a delay in processing) by itself constitutes the recognition event, which triggers downstream quality control. Because whether inappropriate molecules are specifically recognized remains unclear in many cases, we will adopt the more relaxed definition of {RNA} quality control. {RNA} repair remains episodic and the degradative elimination of crippled molecules appears to be the rule. Therefore we will briefly describe the actors of {RNA} degradation in the nucleus. Detailed analyses of the mechanism of action of these enzymes can be found in several excellent and recent reviews, including in this issue. Finally, we will restrict our analysis to the yeast model, which is used in the majority of {RNA} quality control studies, but examples exist in the literature indicating that many of the principles of {RNA} quality control described in yeast also apply to other eukaryotes.

Def1 processing results in the removal of a domain promoting cytoplasmic localization, resulting in nuclear accumulation of the clipped protein. Nuclear Def1 then binds {RNAPII,} utilizing a ubiquitin-binding domain to recruit the {Elongin-Cullin} E3 ligase complex via a {ubiquitin-homology\&\#xA0;domain} in the Ela1 protein. This facilitates polyubiquitylation of Rpb1, triggering its proteasome-mediated degradation.

  abstract={Recent experiments provide an unprecedented view of {protein-DNA} binding in yeast and human genomes at single-nucleotide resolution. These measurements, performed over large cell populations, show quite generally that sequence-specific transcription regulators with well-defined {protein-DNA} consensus motifs bind only a fraction among all consensus motifs present in the genome. Alternatively, proteins in vivo often bind {DNA} regions lacking known consensus sequences. The rules determining whether a consensus motif is functional remain incompletely understood. Here we predict that genomic background surrounding specific {protein-DNA} binding motifs statistically modulates the binding of sequence-specific transcription regulators to these motifs. In particular, we show that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding in yeast is statistically enhanced, on average, around functional Reb1 motifs that are bound as compared to nonfunctional Reb1 motifs that are unbound. The landscape of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding around functional {CTCF} motifs in human demonstrates a more complex behavior. In particular, human genomic regions characterized by the highest {CTCF} occupancy, show statistically reduced level of nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding. Our findings suggest that nonconsensus {protein-DNA} binding is fine-tuned around functional binding sites using a variety of design strategies.},

  abstract={Because {DNA} packaging in nucleosomes modulates its accessibility to transcription factors {(TFs),} unraveling the causal determinants of nucleosome positioning is of great importance to understanding gene regulation. Although there is evidence that intrinsic sequence specificity contributes to nucleosome positioning, the extent to which other factors contribute to nucleosome positioning is currently highly debated. Here we obtained both in vivo and in vitro reference maps of positions that are either consistently covered or free of nucleosomes across multiple experimental data-sets in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then systematically quantified the contribution of {TF} binding to nucleosome positioning using a rigorous statistical mechanics model in which {TFs} compete with nucleosomes for binding {DNA.} Our results reconcile previous seemingly conflicting results on the determinants of nucleosome positioning and provide a quantitative explanation for the difference between in vivo and in vitro positioning. On a genome-wide scale, nucleosome positioning is dominated by the phasing of nucleosome arrays over gene bodies, and their positioning is mainly determined by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. In contrast, larger nucleosome free regions in promoters, which likely have a much more significant impact on gene expression, are determined mainly by {TF} binding. Interestingly, of the 158 yeast {TFs} included in our modeling, we find that only 10-20 significantly contribute to inducing nucleosome-free regions, and these {TFs} are highly enriched for having direct interactions with chromatin remodelers. Together our results imply that nucleosome free regions in yeast promoters results from the binding of a specific class of {TFs} that recruit chromatin remodelers.},

  abstract={The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revealed that pervasive transcription generates {RNAs} from nearly all regions of eukaryotic genomes. Normally, these transcripts undergo rapid degradation by a nuclear {RNA} surveillance system primarily featuring the {RNA} exosome. This multimeric protein complex plays a critical role in the efficient turnover and processing of a vast array of {RNAs} in the nucleus. Despite its initial discovery over a decade ago, important questions remain concerning the mechanisms that recruit and activate the nuclear exosome. Specificity and modulation of exosome activity requires additional protein cofactors, including the conserved {TRAMP} polyadenylation complex. Recent studies suggest that helicase and {RNA-binding} subunits of {TRAMP} direct {RNA} substrates for polyadenylation, which enhances their degradation by {Dis3/Rrp44} and Rrp6, the two exosome-associated ribonucleases. These findings indicate that the exosome and {TRAMP} have evolved highly flexible functions that allow recognition of a wide range of {RNA} substrates. This flexibility provides the nuclear {RNA} surveillance system with the ability to regulate the levels of a broad range of coding and noncoding {RNAs,} which results in profound effects on gene expression, cellular development, gene silencing, and heterochromatin formation. This review summarizes recent findings on the nuclear {RNA} surveillance complexes, and speculates upon possible mechanisms for {TRAMP-mediated} substrate recognition and exosome activation.},

The {Mtl1-Red1} core promotes degradation of {mRNAs} and noncoding {RNAs} and associates with different proteins to assemble heterochromatin via distinct mechanisms. Mtl1 also forms Red1-independent interactions with evolutionarily conserved proteins named Nrl1 and Ctr1, which associate with splicing factors. Whereas Nrl1 targets transcripts with cryptic introns to form heterochromatin at developmental genes and retrotransposons, Ctr1 functions in processing intron-containing telomerase {RNA.} Together with our discovery of widespread cryptic introns, including in noncoding {RNAs,} these findings reveal unique cellular strategies for recognizing regulatory {RNAs} and coordinating their functions in response to developmental and environmental cues.},

Moderate-level transcription of eukaryotic genes by Pol {II} is accompanied by nucleosome survival, extensive exchange of histones {H2A/H2B} and minimal exchange of histones {H3/H4.} Complementary in vitro studies have shown that transcription through chromatin by single Pol {II} complexes is uniquely coupled with nucleosome survival via formation of a small intranucleosomal {DNA} loop {(\&\#xD8;-loop)} containing the transcribing enzyme. In contrast, transient displacement and exchange of all core histones are observed during intense transcription. Indeed, multiple transcribing Pol {II} complexes can efficiently overcome the high nucleosomal barrier and displace the entire histone octamer in vitro. Thus, various Pol {II} complexes can remodel chromatin to different extents. The mechanisms of nucleosome survival and displacement during transcription and the role of {DNA-histone} interactions and various factors during this process are discussed.

  abstract={Pausing of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAP} {II)} by backtracking on {DNA} is a major regulatory mechanism in control of eukaryotic transcription. Backtracking occurs by extrusion of the 3' end of the {RNA} from the active center after bond formation and before translocation of {RNAP} {II} on {DNA.} In several documented cases, backtracking requires a special signal such as {A/T-rich} sequences forming an unstable {RNA-DNA} hybrid in the elongation complex. However, other sequence-dependent backtracking signals and conformations of {RNAP} {II} leading to backtracking remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate with S. cerevisiae {RNAP} {II} that a cleavage-deficient elongation factor {TFIIS} {(TFIIS(AA))} enhances backtracked pauses during regular transcription. This is due to increased efficiency of formation of an intermediate that leads to backtracking. This intermediate may involve misalignment at the 3' end of the nascent {RNA} in the active center of the yeast {RNAP} {II,} and {TFIIS(AA)} promotes formation of this intermediate at the {DNA} sequences, presenting a high-energy barrier to translocation. We proposed a three-step mechanism for {RNAP} {II} pausing in which a prolonged dwell time in the pre-translocated state increases the likelihood of the 3' {RNA} end misalignment facilitating a backtrack pausing. These results demonstrate an important role of the intrinsic blocks to forward translocation in pausing by {RNAP} {II.}},

A strain, in which three origins were inactivated, confirmed that the distribution of termination events is primarily dictated by the stochastic activation time of origins. Cell-to-cell variability in origin activity ensures that termination events are widely distributed across virtually the whole genome.

However, the dearth of information on origins in diverse yeasts limits the availability of efficient replication origin modules to only a handful of species and restricts our understanding of origin function and evolution. To enable rapid study of origins, we have developed a sequencing-based suite of methods for comprehensively mapping and characterizing {ARSs} within a yeast genome. Our approach finely maps genomic inserts capable of supporting plasmid replication and uses massively parallel deep mutational scanning to define molecular determinants of {ARS} function with single-nucleotide resolution. In addition to providing unprecedented detail into origin structure, our data have allowed us to design short, synthetic {DNA} sequences that retain maximal {ARS} function.

Variation in transcripts can affect messenger {RNA} stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of {RNA} molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping {RNA} molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding {RNAs} and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70\% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as {RNA} abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes.},

  abstract={Proper {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} transcription termination is essential to generate stable transcripts, to prevent interference at downstream loci, and to recycle Pol {II} back to the promoter (1-3). As such, termination is an intricately controlled process that is tightly regulated by a variety of different cis- and trans-acting factors (4, 5). Although many eukaryotic termination factors have been identified to date, the details of the precise molecular mechanisms governing termination remain to be elucidated. We devised an in vitro transcription system to study specific Pol {II} termination. We show for the first time that the exonucleolytic {Rat1\&\#xB7;Rai1} complex can elicit the release of stalled Pol {II} in vitro and can do so in the absence of other factors. We also find that Rtt103, which interacts with the Pol {II} C-terminal domain {(CTD)} and with Rat1, can rescue termination activity of an exonucleolytically deficient Rat1 mutant. In light of our findings, we posit a model whereby functional nucleolytic activity is not the feature of Rat1 that ultimately promotes termination. Degradation of the nascent transcript allows Rat1 to pursue Pol {II} in a guided fashion and arrive at the site of {RNA} exit from Pol {II.} Upon this arrival, however, it is perhaps the specific and direct contact between Rat1 and Pol {II} that transmits the signal to terminate transcription.},

Although slower, {S2A} {RNAP} {II} was able to transcribe. However, it failed to recruit splicing components such as {U2AF65} and U2 {snRNA} to transcription sites, although the recruitment of U1 {snRNA} was not affected. As a consequence, co-transcriptional splicing was impaired. Interestingly, the magnitude of the {S2A} {RNAP} {II} splicing defect was promoter dependent. In addition, {S2A} {RNAP} {II} showed an impaired recruitment of the cleavage factor {PCF11} to {pre-mRNA} and a defect in 3'-end {RNA} cleavage. These results suggest that {CTD} Ser2 plays critical roles in co-transcriptional {pre-mRNA} maturation in vivo: It likely recruits {U2AF65} to ensure an efficient co-transcriptional splicing and facilitates the recruitment of {pre-mRNA} 3'-end processing factors to enhance 3'-end cleavage.},

  abstract={Splicing is the removal of intron sequences from {pre-mRNA} by the spliceosome. Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that {pre-mRNA} can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally). Co-transcriptional splicing does not assume that transcription and splicing machineries are mechanistically coupled, yet it raises this possibility. Early studies were based on a limited number of genes, which were often chosen because of their experimental accessibility. Since 2010, eight studies have used global datasets as counting tools, in order to quantify co-transcriptional intron removal. The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Here, we discuss the nature of the various global datasets and how bioinformatic analyses were conducted. Considering the broad differences in experimental approach and analysis, the level of agreement on the prevalence of co-transcriptional splicing is remarkable.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotic cells initiates from multiple replication origins that are distributed throughout the genome. Coordinating the usage of these origins is crucial to ensure complete and timely replication of the entire genome precisely once in each cell cycle. Replication origins fire according to a cell-type-specific temporal programme, which is established in the G1 phase of each cell cycle. In response to conditions causing the slowing or stalling of {DNA} replication forks, the programme of origin firing is altered in two contrasting ways, depending on chromosomal context. First, inactive or 'dormant' replication origins in the vicinity of the stalled replication fork become activated and, second, the S phase checkpoint induces a global shutdown of further origin firing throughout the genome. Here, we review our current understanding on the role of dormant origins and the S phase checkpoint in the rescue of stalled forks and the completion of {DNA} replication in the presence of replicative stress.},

Application of this method to murine testis {RNA} identified 69 {ecircRNAs} in precisely orthologous locations to human circular {RNAs.} Of note, paralogous kinases {HIPK2} and {HIPK3} produce abundant {ecircRNA} from their second exon in both humans and mice.

We used single-molecule resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization {(smFISH)} to investigate antisense-mediated transcription regulation. We show that {PHO84} {AS} {RNA} acts as a bimodal switch, in which continuous, low-frequency antisense transcription represses sense expression within individual cells. Surprisingly, antisense {RNAs} do not accumulate at the {PHO84} gene but are exported to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, rather than stabilizing {PHO84} {AS} {RNA,} the loss of Rrp6 favors its elongation by reducing early transcription termination by {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1.} These observations suggest that {PHO84} silencing results from antisense transcription through the promoter rather than the static accumulation of antisense {RNAs} at the repressed gene.},

  abstract={Transcription by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II),} and all {RNA} polymerases for that matter, may be understood as comprising two cycles. The first cycle relates to the basic mechanism of the transcription process wherein Pol {II} must select the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate complementary to the {DNA} template, catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, and translocate to the next position on the {DNA} template. Performing this cycle in an iterative fashion allows the synthesis of {RNA} chains that can be over one million nucleotides in length in some larger eukaryotes. Overlaid upon this enzymatic cycle, transcription may be divided into another cycle of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Each of these phases has a large number of associated transcription factors that function to promote or regulate the gene expression process. Complicating matters, each phase of the latter transcription cycle are coincident with cotranscriptional {RNA} processing events. Additionally, transcription takes place within a highly dynamic and regulated chromatin environment. This chromatin environment is radically impacted by active transcription and associated chromatin modifications and remodeling, while also functioning as a major platform for Pol {II} regulation. This review will focus on our basic knowledge of the Pol {II} transcription mechanism, and how altered Pol {II} activity impacts gene expression in vivo in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

To evaluate these predictions, we analysed transcription through a nucleosome by different, structurally related {RNA} polymerases and mutant yeast Pol {II} having different histone-interacting surfaces that presumably stabilize the {\&\#xD8;-loop.} The height of the nucleosomal barrier to transcription and efficiency of nucleosome survival correlate with the net negative charges of the histone-interacting surfaces.

  abstract={Nab3 and Nrd1 are yeast heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein {(hnRNP)-like} proteins that heterodimerize and bind {RNA.} Genetic and biochemical evidence reveals that they are integral to the termination of transcription of short non-coding {RNAs} by {RNA} polymerase {II.} Here we define a Nab3 mutation (nab3\&\#x394;134) that removes an essential part of the protein's C terminus but nevertheless can rescue, in trans, the phenotype resulting from a mutation in the {RNA} recognition motif of Nab3. This low complexity region of Nab3 appears intrinsically unstructured and can form a hydrogel in vitro. These data support a model in which multiple {Nrd1-Nab3} heterodimers polymerize onto substrate {RNA} to effect termination, allowing complementation of one mutant Nab3 molecule by another lacking a different function. The self-association property of Nab3 adds to the previously documented interactions between these {hnRNP-like} proteins, {RNA} polymerase {II,} and the nascent transcript, leading to a network of nucleoprotein interactions that define a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex. This was underscored from the synthetic phenotypes of yeast strains with pairwise combinations of Nrd1 and Nab3 mutations known to affect their distinct biochemical activities. The mutations included a Nab3 self-association defect, a {Nab3-Nrd1} heterodimerization defect, a Nrd1-polymerase {II} binding defect, and an {Nab3-RNA} recognition motif mutation. Although no single mutation was lethal, cells with any two mutations were not viable for four such pairings, and a fifth displayed a synthetic growth defect. These data strengthen the idea that a multiplicity of interactions is needed to assemble a higher order {Nrd1-Nab3} complex that coats specific nascent {RNAs} in preparation for termination.},

  abstract={Nucleosomes in all eukaryotes examined to date adopt a characteristic architecture within genes and play fundamental roles in regulating transcription, yet the identity and precise roles of many of the trans-acting factors responsible for the establishment and maintenance of this organization remain to be identified. We profiled a compendium of 50 yeast strains carrying conditional alleles or complete deletions of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, histone biology, and chromatin remodeling, as well as compounds that target transcription and histone deacetylases, to assess their respective roles in nucleosome positioning and transcription. We find that nucleosome patterning in genes is affected by many factors, including the {CAF-1} complex, Spt10, and Spt21, in addition to previously reported remodeler {ATPases} and histone chaperones. Disruption of these factors or reductions in histone levels led genic nucleosomes to assume positions more consistent with their intrinsic sequence preferences, with pronounced and specific shifts of the +1 nucleosome relative to the transcription start site. These shifts of +1 nucleosomes appear to have functional consequences, as several affected genes in Ino80 mutants exhibited altered expression responses. Our parallel expression profiling compendium revealed extensive transcription changes in intergenic and antisense regions, most of which occur in regions with altered nucleosome occupancy and positioning. We show that the nucleosome-excluding transcription factors Reb1, Abf1, Tbf1, and Rsc3 suppress cryptic transcripts at their target promoters, while a combined analysis of nucleosome and expression profiles identified 36 novel transcripts that are normally repressed by {Tup1/Cyc8.} Our data confirm and extend the roles of chromatin remodelers and chaperones as major determinants of genic nucleosome positioning, and these data provide a valuable resource for future studies.},

  abstract={Transcription termination is essential to generate functional {RNAs} and to prevent disruptive polymerase collisions resulting from concurrent transcription. The yeast Sen1p helicase is involved in termination of most noncoding {RNAs} transcribed by {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII).} However, the mechanism of termination and the role of this protein have remained enigmatic. Here we address the mechanism of Sen1p-dependent termination by using a highly purified in vitro system. We show that Sen1p is the key enzyme of the termination reaction and reveal features of the termination mechanism. Like the bacterial termination factor Rho, Sen1p recognizes the nascent {RNA} and hydrolyzes {ATP} to dissociate the elongation complex. Sen1p-dependent termination is highly specific and, notably, does not require the C-terminal domain of {RNAPII.} We also show that termination is inhibited by {RNA-DNA} hybrids. Our results elucidate the role of Sen1p in controlling pervasive transcription.},

  abstract={In yeast, ribosome production is controlled transcriptionally by tight coregulation of the 138 ribosomal protein genes {(RPGs).} {RPG} promoters display limited sequence homology, and the molecular basis for their coregulation remains largely unknown. Here we identify two prevalent {RPG} promoter types, both characterized by upstream binding of the general transcription factor {(TF)} Rap1 followed by the {RPG-specific} {Fhl1/Ifh1} pair, with one type also binding the {HMG-B} protein Hmo1. We show that the regulatory properties of the two promoter types are remarkably similar, suggesting that they are determined to a large extent by Rap1 and the {Fhl1/Ifh1} pair. Rapid depletion experiments allowed us to define a hierarchy of {TF} binding in which Rap1 acts as a pioneer factor required for binding of all other {TFs.} We also uncovered unexpected features underlying recruitment of Fhl1, whose forkhead {DNA-binding} domain is not required for binding at most promoters, and Hmo1, whose binding is supported by repeated motifs. Finally, we describe unusually micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)-sensitive} nucleosomes at all {RPG} promoters, located between the canonical +1 and -1 nucleosomes, which coincide with sites of {Fhl1/Ifh1} and Hmo1 binding. We speculate that these "fragile" nucleosomes play an important role in regulating {RPG} transcriptional output.},

We report that {RSC,} an essential chromatin remodeler, is recruited to the open reading frames {(ORFs)} of actively transcribed genes genome wide, suggesting a role for {RSC} in regulating transcription elongation. Consistent with such a role, Pol {II} occupancy in the {ORFs} of weakly transcribed genes is drastically reduced upon depletion of the {RSC} catalytic subunit Sth1. {RSC} inactivation also reduced histone H3 occupancy across transcribed regions. Remarkably, the strongest effects on Pol {II} and H3 occupancy were confined to the genes displaying the greatest {RSC} {ORF} enrichment. Additionally, {RSC} recruitment to the {ORF} requires the activities of the {SAGA} and {NuA4} {HAT} complexes and is aided by the activities of the Pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1.

All the known functions of Rap1 require the known high-affinity and specific interaction of the {DNA-binding} domain with its recognition sequences. In this work, we focus on the interaction of the {DNA-binding} domain of Rap1 {(Rap1(DBD))} with double-stranded {DNA} substrates. Unexpectedly, we found that while {Rap1(DBD)} forms a high-affinity 1:1 complex with its {DNA} recognition site, it can also form lower-affinity complexes with higher stoichiometries on {DNA.} These lower-affinity interactions are independent of the presence of the recognition sequence, and we propose they originate from the ability of {Rap1(DBD)} to bind to {DNA} in two different binding modes. In one high-affinity binding mode, {Rap1(DBD)} likely binds in the conformation observed in the available crystal structures. In the other alternative lower-affinity binding mode, we propose that a single Myb-like domain of the {Rap1(DBD)} makes interactions with {DNA,} allowing for more than one protein molecule to bind to the {DNA} substrates. Our findings suggest that the {Rap1(DBD)} does not simply target the protein to its recognition sequence but rather it might be a possible point of regulation.},

It is established that Nrd1 and Nab3 cooperatively recognize specific termination elements within nascent {RNA,} {GUA[A/G]} and {UCUU[G],} respectively. Interestingly, some transcripts do not require {GUA[A/G]} motif for transcription termination in vivo and binding in vitro, suggesting the existence of alternative Nrd1-binding motifs.

We determined the solution structure of a two-domain {RNA-binding} fragment of Nrd1, formed by an {RNA-recognition} motif and helix-loop bundle. {NMR} and fluorescence data show that not only {GUA[A/G]} but also several other G-rich and {AU-rich} motifs are able to bind Nrd1 with affinity in a low micromolar range.

During S phase, each Mcm2-7 hexamer forms the core of a replicative {DNA} helicase. However, the mechanisms of origin licensing and helicase activation are poorly understood. The helicase loaders {ORC-Cdc6} function to recruit a single {Cdt1-Mcm2-7} heptamer to replication origins prior to Cdt1 release and {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex formation, but how the second Mcm2-7 hexamer is recruited to promote double-hexamer formation is not well understood. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7} complex and an {ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7} complex are reported, which together provide new insights into {DNA} licensing. Detailed structural analysis of the loaded Mcm2-7 double-hexamer complex demonstrates that the two hexamers are interlocked and misaligned along the {DNA} axis and lack {ATP} hydrolysis activity that is essential for {DNA} helicase activity. Moreover, we show that the head-to-head juxtaposition of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer generates a new protein interaction surface that creates a multisubunit-binding site for an S-phase protein kinase that is known to activate {DNA} replication. The data suggest how the double hexamer is assembled and how helicase activity is regulated during {DNA} licensing, with implications for cell cycle control of {DNA} replication and genome stability.},

Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect {DNA} from {GpC} methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible {PHO5} gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the {PHO5} promoter that introduce a {poly(dA:dT)} tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of {PHO5.} By contrast, mutations that altered {AA/TT/AT} periodicity reduced gene expression upon {PHO5} induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for {DNA} antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as "fuzzy" or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

However, the mechanism of Sen1 function is not understood. We created a plasmid-based genetic system to study yeast Sen1 in vivo. Using this system, we show that (1) the minimal essential region of Sen1 corresponds to the helicase domain and one of two flanking nuclear localization sequences; (2) a previously isolated terminator readthrough mutation in the Sen1 helicase domain, {E1597K,} is rescued by a second mutation designed to restore a salt bridge within the first {RecA} domain; and (3) the human ortholog of yeast Sen1, Senataxin, cannot functionally replace Sen1 in yeast. Guided by sequence homology between the conserved helicase domains of Sen1 and Senataxin, we tested the effects of 13 missense mutations that cosegregate with the inherited disorder ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 on Sen1 function. Ten of the disease mutations resulted in transcription readthrough of at least one of three Sen1-dependent termination elements tested. Our genetic system will facilitate the further investigation of structure-function relationships in yeast Sen1 and its orthologs.},

In contrast, {RSC} depletion results in global nucleosome re-positioning: both upstream and downstream nucleosomal arrays shift toward the nucleosome-depleted region {(NDR),} with no change in spacing, resulting in a narrower and partly filled {NDR.} The global picture of {RSC-depleted} chromatin represents the average of a range of chromatin structures, with most genes showing a shift of the +1 or the -1 nucleosome into the {NDR.} Using {RSC} {ChIP} data reported by others, we show that {RSC} occupancy is highest on the coding regions of heavily transcribed genes, though not at their {NDRs.} We propose that {RSC} has a role in restoring chromatin structure after transcription. Analysis of gene pairs in different orientations demonstrates that phasing patterns reflect competition between phasing signals emanating from neighboring {NDRs.} These signals may be in phase, resulting in constructive interference and a regular array, or out of phase, resulting in destructive interference and fuzzy positioning. We propose a modified barrier model, in which a stable complex located at the {NDR} acts as a bidirectional phasing barrier. In {RSC-depleted} cells, this barrier has a smaller footprint, resulting in narrower {NDRs.} Thus, {RSC} plays a critical role in organizing yeast chromatin.},

We previously showed that accumulation of {PHO84} antisense {RNA} {(asRNA),} in cells lacking the nuclear exosome component Rrp6, is paralleled by repression of sense transcription in a process dependent on the Hda1 histone deacetylase {(HDAC)} and the {H3K4} histone methyl transferase Set1. Here we investigate this process genome-wide and measure the whole transcriptome of various histone modification mutants in a \&\#x394;rrp6 strain using tiling arrays. We confirm widespread occurrence of potentially antisense-dependent gene regulation and identify three functionally distinct classes of genes that accumulate {asRNAs} in the absence of Rrp6. These classes differ in whether the genes are silenced by the {asRNA} and whether the silencing is {HDACs} and histone methyl transferase-dependent. Among the distinguishing features of {asRNAs} with regulatory potential, we identify weak early termination by {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1,} extension of the {asRNA} into the open reading frame promoter and dependence of the silencing capacity on Set1 and the {HDACs} Hda1 and Rpd3 particularly at promoters undergoing extensive chromatin remodelling. Finally, depending on the efficiency of {Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1} early termination, {asRNA} levels are modulated and their capability of silencing is changed.},

Efficient and timely transcription termination is crucial to control pervasive transcription and prevent transcriptional interference. In yeast, transcription termination of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} occurs via two possible pathways that both require recognition of termination signals on nascent {RNA} by specific factors. We describe here an additional mechanism of transcription termination for {RNAPII} and demonstrate its biological significance. We show that the transcriptional activator Reb1p bound to {DNA} is a roadblock for {RNAPII,} which pauses and is ubiquitinated, thus triggering termination. Reb1p-dependent termination generates a class of cryptic transcripts that {are\&\#xA0;degraded} in the nucleus by the exosome. We also observed transcriptional interference between neighboring genes in the absence of Reb1p. This work demonstrates the importance of roadblock termination for controlling pervasive transcription and preventing transcription through gene regulatory regions.},

This technique, {BruDRB-seq,} revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid elongation rates showed higher densities of {H3K79me2} and {H4K20me1} histone marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore, high elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity {DNA} sequence and distance from nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included the density of exons, long terminal repeats, {GC} content of the gene and {DNA} methylation density in the bodies of genes. Our results suggest that some static gene features influence transcription elongation rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by epigenetic regulation.

  abstract={{ChIP-seq} has become a major tool for the genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding or histone modification sites. Most peak-calling algorithms require input control datasets to model the occurrence of background reads to account for local sequencing and {GC} bias. However, the {GC-content} of reads in Input-seq datasets deviates significantly from that in {ChIP-seq} datasets. Moreover, we observed that a commonly used peak calling program performed equally well when the use of a simulated uniform background set was compared to an Input-seq dataset. This contradicts the assumption that input control datasets are necessary to fatefully reflect the background read distribution. Because the {GC-content} of the abundant single reads in {ChIP-seq} datasets is similar to those of randomly sampled regions we designed a peak-calling algorithm with a background model based on overlapping single reads. The application, {OccuPeak,} uses the abundant low frequency tags present in each {ChIP-seq} dataset to model the background, thereby avoiding the need for additional datasets. Analysis of the performance of {OccuPeak} showed robust model parameters. Its measure of peak significance, the excess ratio, is only dependent on the tag density of a peak and the global noise levels. Compared to the commonly used peak-calling applications {MACS} and {CisGenome,} {OccuPeak} had the highest sensitivity in an enhancer identification benchmark test, and performed similar in an overlap tests of transcription factor occupation with {DNase} I hypersensitive sites and {H3K27ac} sites. Moreover, peaks called by {OccuPeak} were significantly enriched with cardiac disease-associated {SNPs.} {OccuPeak} runs as a standalone application and does not require extensive tweaking of parameters, making its use straightforward and user friendly.

  abstract={Most {RNA} polymerase {(Pol)} {II} promoters lack a {TATA} element, yet nearly all Pol {II} transcription requires {TATA} binding protein {(TBP).} While the {TBP-TATA} interaction is critical for transcription at {TATA-containing} promoters, it has been unclear whether {TBP} sequence-specific {DNA} contacts are required for transcription at {TATA-less} genes. Transcription factor {IID} {(TFIID),} the {TBP-containing} coactivator that functions at most {TATA-less} genes, recognizes short sequence-specific promoter elements in metazoans, but analogous promoter elements have not been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generated a set of mutations in the yeast {TBP} {DNA} binding surface and found that most support growth of yeast. Both in vivo and in vitro, many of these mutations are specifically defective for transcription of two {TATA-containing} genes with only minor defects in transcription of two {TATA-less,} {TFIID-dependent} genes. {TBP} binds several {TATA-less} promoters with apparent high affinity, but our results suggest that this binding is not important for transcription activity. Our results are consistent with the model that sequence-specific {TBP-DNA} contacts are not important at yeast {TATA-less} genes and suggest that other general transcription factors or coactivator subunits are responsible for recognition of {TATA-less} promoters. Our results also explain why yeast {TBP} derivatives defective for {TATA} binding appear defective in activated transcription.},

Here we provide structural and functional evidence demonstrating that the same domain of Nrd1p interacts with {RNA} polymerase {II} and Trf4p in a mutually exclusive manner, thus defining two alternative forms of the {NNS} complex, one involved in termination and the other in degradation. We show that the {Nrd1-Trf4} interaction is required for optimal exosome activity {in\&\#xA0;vivo} and for the stimulation of polyadenylation of {NNS} targets by {TRAMP} {in\&\#xA0;vitro.} We propose that transcription termination and {RNA} degradation are coordinated by switching between two alternative partners of the {NNS} complex.},

  abstract={Understanding the role of a given transcription factor {(TF)} in regulating gene expression requires precise mapping of its binding sites in the genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-exo, an emerging technique using {\&\#x3BB;} exonuclease to digest {TF} unbound {DNA} after {ChIP,} is designed to reveal transcription factor binding site {(TFBS)} boundaries with near-single nucleotide resolution. Although {ChIP-exo} promises deeper insights into transcription regulation, no dedicated bioinformatics tool exists to leverage its advantages. Most {ChIP-seq} and {ChIP-chip} analytic methods are not tailored for {ChIP-exo,} and thus cannot take full advantage of high-resolution {ChIP-exo} data. Here we describe a novel analysis framework, termed {MACE} (model-based analysis of {ChIP-exo)} dedicated to {ChIP-exo} data analysis. The {MACE} workflow consists of four steps: (i) sequencing data normalization and bias correction; (ii) signal consolidation and noise reduction; (iii) single-nucleotide resolution border peak detection using the Chebyshev Inequality and (iv) border matching using the {Gale-Shapley} stable matching algorithm. When applied to published human {CTCF,} yeast Reb1 and our own mouse {ONECUT1/HNF6} {ChIP-exo} data, {MACE} is able to define {TFBSs} with high sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution, as evidenced by multiple criteria including motif enrichment, sequence conservation, direct sequence pileup, nucleosome positioning and open chromatin states. In addition, we show that the fundamental advance of {MACE} is the identification of two boundaries of a {TFBS} with high resolution, whereas other methods only report a single location of the same event. The two boundaries help elucidate the in vivo binding structure of a given {TF,} e.g. whether the {TF} may bind as dimers or in a complex with other co-factors.},

We therefore monitored {mRNA} expression genome-wide, for individual deletions of one-quarter of yeast genes, focusing on (putative) regulators. The resulting genetic perturbation signatures reflect many different properties. These include the architecture of protein complexes and pathways, identification of expression changes compatible with viability, and the varying responsiveness to genetic perturbation. The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop {(FFL)} types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 {FFLs} that likely represent feedback. Systematic transcription factor classification shows a surprisingly high abundance of gene-specific repressors, suggesting that yeast chromatin is not as generally restrictive to transcription as is often assumed.

  abstract={The major function of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerase {III} is to transcribe transfer {RNA,} {5S} ribosomal {RNA,} and other small non-protein-coding {RNA} molecules. Assembly of the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex on chromosomal {DNA} requires the sequential binding of transcription factor complexes {TFIIIC} and {TFIIIB.} Recent evidence has suggested that in addition to producing {RNA} transcripts, chromatin-assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes may mediate additional nuclear functions that include chromatin boundary, nucleosome phasing, and general genome organization activities. This study provides evidence of another such "extratranscriptional" activity of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes, which is the ability to block progression of intergenic {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription. We demonstrate that the {RNA} polymerase {III} complex bound to the {tRNA} gene upstream of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae {ATG31} gene protects the {ATG31} promoter against readthrough transcriptional interference from the upstream noncoding intergenic {SUT467} transcription unit. This protection is predominately mediated by binding of the {TFIIIB} complex. When {TFIIIB} binding to this {tRNA} gene is weakened, an extended {SUT467-ATG31} readthrough transcript is produced, resulting in compromised {ATG31} translation. Since the {ATG31} gene product is required for autophagy, strains expressing the readthrough transcript exhibit defective autophagy induction and reduced fitness under autophagy-inducing nitrogen starvation conditions. Given the recent discovery of widespread pervasive transcription in all forms of life, protection of neighboring genes from intergenic transcriptional interference may be a key extratranscriptional function of assembled {RNA} polymerase {III} complexes and possibly other {DNA} binding proteins.},

Deleting the {tSH2} domain, however, only has a partial effect on Spt6 occupancy in vivo, suggesting that more complex mechanisms are involved in the Spt6 recruitment. Our results show that the Ser2 kinases Bur1 and Ctk1, but not the Ser5 kinase Kin28, cooperate in recruiting Spt6, genome-wide. Interestingly, the Ser2 kinases promote the association of Spt6 in early transcribed regions and not toward the 3' ends of genes, where phosphorylated Ser2 reaches its maximum level. In addition, our results uncover an unexpected role for histone deacetylases {(Rpd3} and Hos2) in promoting Spt6 interaction with elongating Pol {II.} Finally, our data suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol {II} {CTD} on Tyr1 promotes the association of Spt6 with the 3' ends of transcribed genes, independently of Ser2 phosphorylation. Collectively, our results show that a complex network of interactions, involving the Spt6 {tSH2} domain, {CTD} phosphorylation, and histone deacetylases, coordinate the recruitment of Spt6 to transcribed genes in vivo.},

  abstract={De-novo reverse-engineering of genome-scale regulatory networks is a fundamental problem of biological and translational research. One of the major obstacles in developing and evaluating approaches for de-novo gene network reconstruction is the absence of high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions. To establish a foundation for assessing the accuracy of de-novo gene network reverse-engineering, we constructed high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporate binding and gene knockout data. Then we used 7 performance metrics to assess accuracy of 18 statistical association-based approaches for de-novo network reverse-engineering in 13 different datasets spanning over 4 data types. We found that most reconstructed networks had statistically significant accuracies. We also determined which statistical approaches and datasets/data types lead to networks with better reconstruction accuracies. While we found that de-novo reverse-engineering of the entire network is a challenging problem, it is possible to reconstruct sub-networks around some transcription factors with good accuracy. The latter transcription factors can be identified by assessing their connectivity in the inferred networks. Overall, this study provides the gene network reverse-engineering community with a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of S. cerevisiae gene network reconstruction and variability in performance of various approaches for learning both the entire network and sub-networks around transcription factors.},

  abstract={{tRNAs} are encoded by {RNA} polymerase {III-transcribed} genes that reside at seemingly random intervals along the chromosomes of budding yeast. Existing evidence suggests that the genes congregate together at the nucleolus and/or centromeres. In this study, we re-examined spatial and temporal aspects of {tRNA} gene {(tDNA)} expression. We show that {tDNA} transcription fluctuates during cell cycle progression. In M phase, when {tRNA} synthesis peaks, {tDNAs} localize at nuclear pore complexes {(NPCs).} Docking of a {tDNA} requires the {DNA} sequence of the contacted gene, nucleoporins Nup60 and Nup2, and cohesin. Characterization of mutants that block {NPC} localization revealed that docking is a consequence of elevated {tDNA} transcription. {NPC-tDNA} contact falters in the absence of the principal exportin of nascent {tRNA,} Los1, and genetic assays indicate that gating of {tDNAs} at {NPCs} favors cytoplasmic accumulation of functional {tRNA.} Collectively, the data suggest that {tDNAs} associate with {NPCs} to coordinate {RNA} polymerase {III} transcription with the nuclear export of {pre-tRNA.} The M-phase specificity of {NPC} contact reflects a regulatory mechanism that may have evolved, in part, to avoid collisions between {DNA} replication forks and transcribing {RNA} polymerase {III} machinery at {NPCs.}},

  abstract={Growth condition perturbation or gene function disruption are commonly used strategies to study cellular systems. Although it is widely appreciated that such experiments may involve indirect effects, these frequently remain uncharacterized. Here, analysis of functionally unrelated Saccharyomyces cerevisiae deletion strains reveals a common gene expression signature. One property shared by these strains is slower growth, with increased presence of the signature in more slowly growing strains. The slow growth signature is highly similar to the environmental stress response {(ESR),} an expression response common to diverse environmental perturbations. Both environmental and genetic perturbations result in growth rate changes. These are accompanied by a change in the distribution of cells over different cell cycle phases. Rather than representing a direct expression response in single cells, both the slow growth signature and {ESR} mainly reflect a redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases, primarily characterized by an increase in the G1 population. The findings have implications for any study of perturbation that is accompanied by growth rate changes. Strategies to counter these effects are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={Dissecting the molecular basis of quantitative traits is a significant challenge and is essential for understanding complex diseases. Even in model organisms, precisely determining causative genes and their interactions has remained elusive, due in part to difficulty in narrowing intervals to single genes and in detecting epistasis or linked quantitative trait loci. These difficulties are exacerbated by limitations in experimental design, such as low numbers of analyzed individuals or of polymorphisms between parental genomes. We address these challenges by applying three independent high-throughput approaches for {QTL} mapping to map the genetic variants underlying 11 phenotypes in two genetically distant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, namely (1) individual analysis of \&gt;700 meiotic segregants, (2) bulk segregant analysis, and (3) reciprocal hemizygosity scanning, a new genome-wide method that we developed. We reveal differences in the performance of each approach and, by combining them, identify eight polymorphic genes that affect eight different phenotypes: colony shape, flocculation, growth on two nonfermentable carbon sources, and resistance to two drugs, salt, and high temperature. Our results demonstrate the power of individual segregant analysis to dissect {QTL} and address the underestimated contribution of interactions between variants. We also reveal confounding factors like mutations and aneuploidy in pooled approaches, providing valuable lessons for future designs of complex trait mapping studies.},

Here, we systematically discriminate between the molecular phenotypes of overlapping coding and non-coding transcriptional events from each genic locus using a novel genome-wide, nucleotide-resolution technique to quantify the half-lives of 3' transcript isoforms in yeast. Our results reveal widespread differences in stability among isoforms for hundreds of genes in a single condition, and that variation of even a single nucleotide in the 3' untranslated region {(UTR)} can affect transcript stability. While previous instances of negative associations between 3' {UTR} length and transcript stability have been reported, here, we find that shorter isoforms are not necessarily more stable. We demonstrate the role of {RNA-protein} interactions in conditioning isoform-specific stability, showing that {PUF3} binds and destabilizes specific polyadenylation isoforms. Our findings indicate that although the functional elements of a gene are encoded in {DNA} sequence, the selective incorporation of these elements into {RNA} through transcript boundary variation allows a single gene to have diverse functional consequences.},

  abstract={Identifying genes in the genomic context is central to a cell's ability to interpret the genome. Yet, in general, the signals used to define eukaryotic genes are poorly described. Here, we derived simple classifiers that identify where transcription will initiate and terminate using nucleic acid sequence features detectable by the yeast cell, which we integrate into a Unified Model {(UM)} that models transcription as a whole. The cis-elements that denote where transcription initiates function primarily through nucleosome depletion, and, using a synthetic promoter system, we show that most of these elements are sufficient to initiate transcription in vivo. Hrp1 binding sites are the major characteristic of terminators; these binding sites are often clustered in terminator regions and can terminate transcription bidirectionally. The {UM} predicts global transcript structure by modeling transcription of the genome using a hidden Markov model whose emissions are the outputs of the initiation and termination classifiers. We validated the novel predictions of the {UM} with available {RNA-seq} data and tested it further by directly comparing the transcript structure predicted by the model to the transcription generated by the cell for synthetic {DNA} segments of random design. We show that the {UM} identifies transcription start sites more accurately than the initiation classifier alone, indicating that the relative arrangement of promoter and terminator elements influences their function. Our model presents a concrete description of how the cell defines transcript units, explains the existence of nongenic transcripts, and provides insight into genome evolution.},

Several studies based on gene expression profiling have been performed with the aim of gaining insights into the pathogenesis of {RCC;} however, few studies have investigated {RCC} at the pathway level to search for the possible pathways involved in clear cell {RCC} {(CCRCC).} In this study, gene set enrichment analysis {(GSEA)} was conducted on microarray datasets from {CCRCC} tissue. {DAVID} functional enrichment analysis was performed based on the dysregulated genes that were identified in a meta-analysis performed on the microarray datasets from {CCRCC} tissue. In {GSEA,} 17 down- and 12 upregulated pathways coexisted in six datasets. The majority of the upregulated pathways were associated with the immune system. In addition, 32 dysregulated pathways were obtained from {DAVID} functional enrichment analysis, based on the abnormal genes identified by meta-analysis. This study demonstrated that {cross-GSEA} is a useful method for exploring the critical pathways involved {CCRCC;} however, an individual dataset with a small sample may introduce bias.

To define determinants of divergent promoter directionality, we used genomic replacement experiments. Sequences within noncoding transcripts specified their degradation pathways, and functional protein-coding transcripts could be produced in the divergent direction. To screen for mutants affecting the ratio of transcription in each direction, a bidirectional fluorescent protein reporter construct was introduced into the yeast nonessential gene deletion collection. We identified chromatin assembly as an important regulator of divergent transcription. Mutations in the {CAF-I} complex caused genome-wide derepression of nascent divergent noncoding transcription. In opposition to the {CAF-I} chromatin assembly pathway, {H3K56} hyperacetylation, together with the nucleosome remodeler {SWI/SNF,} facilitated divergent transcription by promoting rapid nucleosome turnover. We propose that these chromatin-mediated effects control divergent transcription initiation, complementing downstream pathways linked to early termination and degradation of the noncoding {RNAs.}},

  abstract={{"One,} no one and one hundred thousand" is a masterpiece of Italian literature, written by Luigi Pirandello. The central theme is that in each individual there are multiple personalities, since one's perception of one's self differs from the view of others. As a consequence, a unique identity does not exist, but rather one hundred thousand. This concept can be very well applied to the kinetochore, one of the largest macromolecular complexes conserved in eukaryotes. The kinetochore is essential during cell division and fulfills different sophisticated functions, including linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules and delaying anaphase onset in case of incorrect bi-orientation. In order to perform these tasks, the kinetochore shapes its structure by recruiting different subunits, such as the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint {(SAC)} or the monopolin complex during meiosis. It also modifies its internal organization by rearranging intramolecular connections and acquiring a distinct identity at different time points of cell division. In this review, we describe recent insights into the changes in composition and configuration of the kinetochore in mitosis and meiosis, focusing on the kinetochore of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

  abstract={A wide variety of large-scale data have been produced in bioinformatics. In response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses because of factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new generations of storage devices have emerged, such as {NAND} flash-based solid-state drives {(SSDs),} and with the renewed interest in near-data processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement of hard disk drives by {SSDs} results in dramatic speedup. Despite the various advantages and continuous cost reduction of {SSDs,} there has been little review of {SSD-based} profiling and performance exploration of important but time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research, we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit {SSDs.} The programs we profile cover traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly, mapping, expression analysis, variant calling and metagenomics. We explain how acceleration by parallelization can be combined with {SSDs} for improved performance and also how using {SSDs} can expedite important bioinformatics pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and transcriptome analysis using {RNA} sequencing. We hope that this review can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful storage devices.},

  abstract={Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small {RNA-sequencing} experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental {RNA-sequencing} data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package.},

Using in vitro transcription termination assays, we have found that {RNAPII} is prone to more effective termination by {Rat1/Rai1} when its catalytic site is disrupted due to {NTP} misincorporation, implying that paused {RNAPII,} which is often found in vivo near termination sites, could adopt a similar configuration to {Rat1/Rai1} and trigger termination. Intriguingly, yeast {Rat1/Rai1} does not terminate Escherichia coli {RNAP,} implying that a specific interaction between {Rat1/Rai1} and {RNAPII} may be required for termination. Furthermore, the efficiency of termination increases as the {RNA} transcript undergoing degradation by Rat1 gets longer, which suggests that Rat1 may generate a driving force for dissociating {RNAPII} from the template while degrading the nascent transcripts to catch up to the polymerase. These results indicate that multiple mechanistic features contribute to Rat1-mediated termination of {RNAPII.}},

  abstract={One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors {(TFs)} and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer activation usually requires combinations of several {TFs,} indicating that {TFs} function synergistically and combinatorially. However, while {TF} binding has been extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of {TFs} and cofactors control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which {TFs} participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different {TFs} form functionally distinct groups, or if certain {TFs} might substitute for each other in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory contributions of {TFs} and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with enhancer complementation assays. We recruited {GAL4-DNA-binding-domain} fusions of 812 Drosophila {TFs} and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors. Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of {TFs} that differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar {TFs} can substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging {TF} motifs, and {TF-cofactor} pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The systematic functional characterization of {TFs} and cofactors should further our understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.},

  abstract={Genes are often transcribed in random bursts followed by long periods of inactivity. Here we employ the light-activatable white collar complex {(WCC)} of Neurospora to study the transcriptional bursting with a population approach. Activation of {WCC} by a light pulse triggers a synchronized wave of transcription from the frequency promoter followed by an extended period {(\&\#x223C;1\&\#x2009;h)} during which the promoter is refractory towards restimulation. When challenged by a second light pulse, the newly activated {WCC} binds to refractory promoters and has the potential to recruit {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II).} However, accumulation of Pol {II} and phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain repeats at serine 5 are impaired. Our results suggest that refractory promoters carry a physical memory of their recent transcription history. Genome-wide analysis of light-induced transcription suggests that refractoriness is rather widespread and a property of promoter architecture.},

  abstract={Transcription termination occurs when the polymerase is released after a transcription event, thus delimitating transcription units; however, the functional importance of termination extends beyond the mere definition of gene borders. By determining the cellular fate of the generated transcripts, transcription termination pathways shape the transcriptome. Recent reports have underscored the crucial role of these pathways in limiting the extent of pervasive transcription, which has attracted interest in post-initiation events in gene expression control. Transcription termination pathways involved in the production of non-coding {RNAs} - such as the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} pathway in yeast and the cap-binding complex {(CBC)-ARS2} pathway in humans - are key determinants of transcription quality control. Understanding the mechanisms leading to the timely and efficient dismantling of elongation complexes remains a major unmet challenge, but new insights into the molecular basis of termination at {mRNA-coding} and non-coding {RNA} gene targets have been gained in eukaryotes.},

It consists of a histone octamer associated with {\&\#x223C;80} base pair (bp) of {DNA,} which is located at a position that corresponds to the central 80 bp of a nucleosome core particle. Monomeric prenucleosomes with free flanking {DNA} do not spontaneously fold into nucleosomes but can be converted into canonical nucleosomes by an {ATP-driven} motor protein such as {ACF} or Chd1. In addition, histone {H3K56,} which is located at the {DNA} entry and exit points of a canonical nucleosome, is specifically acetylated by p300 in prenucleosomes relative to nucleosomes. Prenucleosomes assembled in vitro exhibit properties that are strikingly similar to those of nonnucleosomal {histone-DNA} particles in the upstream region of active promoters in vivo.

  abstract={Eukaryotic {DNA} replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge. Termination involves local completion of {DNA} synthesis, decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. Termination has been difficult to study because termination events are generally asynchronous and sequence nonspecific. To overcome these challenges, we paused converging replisomes with a site-specific barrier in Xenopus egg extracts. Upon removal of the barrier, forks underwent synchronous and site-specific termination, allowing mechanistic dissection of this process. We show that {DNA} synthesis does not slow detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation of the replicative {CMG} helicase (comprising {CDC45,} {MCM2-7} and {GINS)} occurs only after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of {DNA} synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging {CMGs} pass one another and dissociate from double-stranded {DNA.} This termination mechanism allows rapid completion of {DNA} synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.},

In the present work, we show that loss of the Drosophila tcs3 homolog also leads to a severe reduction in size and demonstrate, for the first time in a non-microbe, that Tcs3 is required for {t(6)A} synthesis. In Drosophila and in mammals, {tRNAi} {(Met)} is a limiting factor for cell and animal growth. We report that the {t(6)A-modified} form of {tRNAi} {(Met)} is the actual limiting factor. We show that changing the proportion of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNAi} {(Met),} by expression of an un-modifiable {tRNAi} {(Met)} or changing the levels of Tcs3, regulate target of rapamycin {(TOR)} kinase activity and influences cell and animal growth in vivo. These findings reveal an unprecedented relationship between the translation machinery and {TOR,} where translation efficiency, limited by the availability of {t(6)A-modified} {tRNA,} determines growth potential in eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract={{RNA-Sequencing} {(RNA-Seq)} has been widely adopted for quantifying gene expression changes in comparative transcriptome analysis. For detecting differentially expressed genes, a variety of statistical methods based on the negative binomial {(NB)} distribution have been proposed. These methods differ in the ways they handle the {NB} nuisance parameters (i.e., the dispersion parameters associated with each gene) to save power, such as by using a dispersion model to exploit an apparent relationship between the dispersion parameter and the {NB} mean. Presumably, dispersion models with fewer parameters will result in greater power if the models are correct, but will produce misleading conclusions if not. This paper investigates this power and robustness trade-off by assessing rates of identifying true differential expression using the various methods under realistic assumptions about {NB} dispersion parameters. Our results indicate that the relative performances of the different methods are closely related to the level of dispersion variation unexplained by the dispersion model. We propose a simple statistic to quantify the level of residual dispersion variation from a fitted dispersion model and show that the magnitude of this statistic gives hints about whether and how much we can gain statistical power by a dispersion-modeling approach.},

Although there are many {NGS} applications, one of the most commonly used techniques {'RNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq)'} is rapidly replacing microarray-based techniques in laboratories around the world. As more and more of such techniques are standardized, allowing technicians to perform these experiments with minimal hands-on time and reduced experimental/operator-dependent biases, the bottleneck of such techniques is clearly visible; that is, data analysis. Further complicating the matter, increasing evidence suggests most of the genome is transcribed into {RNA;} however, the majority of these {RNAs} are not translated into proteins. These {RNAs} that do not become proteins are called 'noncoding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)'.} Although some time has passed since the discovery of {ncRNAs,} their annotations remain poor, making analysis of {RNA-seq} data challenging. Here, we examine the current limitations of {RNA-seq} analysis using case studies focused on the detection of novel transcripts and examination of their characteristics. Finally, we validate the presence of novel transcripts using biological experiments, showing novel transcripts can be accurately identified when a series of filters is applied.

Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (\&lt;1000 bp) {RNAPII} transcripts such as small noncoding {RNAs} {(snRNAs),} cryptic unstable transcripts {(CUTs),} and some stable unannotated transcripts {(SUTs)} that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 {(NNS)} dependent mechanism. {NNS-dependent} termination is coupled to {RNA} 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of {ncRNA} transcripts including {CUTs.} To determine the role of Rrp6 in {NNS} termination globally, we performed {RNA} sequencing {(RNA-Seq)} on total {RNA} and perform {ChIP-exo} analysis of {RNA} Polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} localization. Deletion of {RRP6} promotes hyper-elongation of multiple {NNS-dependent} transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' {RNA} ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in {RNAPII} termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in {mRNA} expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known {NNS} targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at {CUTs.} Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the {NNS} complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end {RNA} processing and/or degradation at specific targets.},

  abstract={Epinephrine is a stress hormone which is sharply increased in response to acute stress and is continuously elevated during persistent stress. Thioredoxin-1 {(Trx-1)} is a redox regulating protein and is induced under various stresses. Our previous study has shown that epinephrine induces the expression of Trx-1. Tyrosine hydroxylase {(TH)} is the major rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis in response to stress. However, how {TH} is regulated by epinephrine is still unknown. In the present study, we found that epinephrine increased the expression of {TH} in a dose- and time-dependent manner in {PC12} cells, which was inhibited by propranolol {(\&\#x3B2;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor), but not by phenoxybenzamine {(\&\#x3B1;-adrenergic} receptor inhibitor). The increase of {TH} was also inhibited by {SQ22536} (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor), {H-89(PKA} inhibitor) and {LY294002} (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor). More importantly, overexpression of Trx-1 significantly enhanced the expression of {TH,} while Trx-1 {siRNA} suppressed {TH} expression induced by epinephrine. These results suggest that Trx-1 is involved in {TH} expression induced by epinephrine in {PC12} cells.},

Here, we use the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the global mechanisms of two germline-enriched {cytoPAPs,} {GLD-2} and {GLD-4,} by combining polysome profiling with {RNA} sequencing. Our analyses suggest that {GLD-2} activity mediates {mRNA} stability of many translationally repressed {mRNAs.} This correlates with a general shortening of long {poly(A)} tails in gld-2-compromised animals, suggesting that most if not all targets are stabilized via robust {GLD-2-mediated} polyadenylation. By contrast, only mild polyadenylation defects are found in gld-4-compromised animals and few {mRNAs} change in abundance. Interestingly, we detect a reduced number of polysomes in gld-4 mutants and {GLD-4} protein co-sediments with polysomes, which together suggest that {GLD-4} might stimulate or maintain translation directly.

Recently, aberrant expression of {DIS3} has been found to be implicated in a range of different cancers. Perhaps most striking is the finding that {DIS3} is recurrently mutated in 11\% of multiple myeloma patients. Much work has been done to elucidate the structural and biochemical characteristics of {DIS3,} including the mechanistic details of its role as an effector of {RNA} decay pathways. Nevertheless, we do not understand how {DIS3} mutations can lead to cancer. There are a number of studies that pertain to the function of {DIS3} at the organismal level. Mutant phenotypes in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and Drosophila suggest {DIS3} homologues have a common role in cell-cycle progression and microtubule assembly. {DIS3} has also recently been implicated in antibody diversification of mouse B-cells. This article aims to review current knowledge of the structure, mechanisms and functions of {DIS3} as well as highlighting the genetic patterns observed within myeloma patients, in order to yield insight into the putative role of {DIS3} mutations in oncogenesis.},

Research over the last decade has blurred these divisions and emphasized the tightly regulated transitions that occur as {RNA} polymerase {II} synthesizes a transcript from start to finish. Transcription termination, the process that marks the end of transcription elongation, is regulated by proteins that interact with the polymerase, nascent transcript, and/or chromatin template. The failure to terminate transcription can cause accumulation of aberrant transcripts and interfere with transcription at downstream genes. Here, we review the mechanism, regulation, and physiological impact of a termination pathway that targets small noncoding transcripts produced by {RNA} polymerase {II.} We emphasize the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} pathway in yeast, in which the process has been extensively studied.

Loss of small silencing {RNAs} or components in their pathways often leads to severe developmental defects, including lethality and sterility. Recently, non-templated addition of nucleotides to the 3' end, namely tailing, was found to associate with the processing and stability of small silencing {RNAs.} Next Generation Sequencing has made it possible to detect such modifications at nucleotide resolution in an unprecedented throughput. Unfortunately, detecting such events from millions of short reads confounded by sequencing errors and {RNA} editing is still a tricky problem. Here, we developed a computational framework, Tailor, driven by an efficient and accurate aligner specifically designed for capturing the tailing events directly from the alignments without extensive post-processing. The performance of Tailor was fully tested and compared favorably with other general-purpose aligners using both simulated and real datasets for tailing analysis. Moreover, to show the broad utility of Tailor, we used Tailor to reanalyze published datasets and revealed novel findings worth further experimental validation.

We also discovered that the Sumo consensus motif at {RPG} promoters is identical to the {DNA} binding motif of the transcription factor Rap1. We demonstrate that Rap1 is a molecular target of Sumo and that sumoylation of Rap1 is important for cell viability. Furthermore, Rap1 sumoylation promotes recruitment of the basal transcription machinery, and sumoylation of Rap1 cooperates with the target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 {(TORC1)} pathway to promote {RPG} transcription. Strikingly, our data reveal that sumoylation of Rap1 functions in a homeostatic feedback loop that sustains {RPG} transcription during translational stress.

  abstract={{DNA} replication in eukaryotes is strictly regulated by several mechanisms. A central step in this replication is the assembly of the heterohexameric minichromosome maintenance {(MCM2-7)} helicase complex at replication origins during G1 phase as an inactive double hexamer. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we report a near-atomic structure of the {MCM2-7} double hexamer purified from yeast G1 chromatin. Our structure shows that two single hexamers, arranged in a tilted and twisted fashion through interdigitated amino-terminal domain interactions, form a kinked central channel. Four constricted rings consisting of conserved interior {\&\#x3B2;-hairpins} from the two single hexamers create a narrow passageway that tightly fits duplex {DNA.} This narrow passageway, reinforced by the offset of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer interface, is flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, {MCM2} and {MCM5.} These unusual features of the twisted and tilted single hexamers suggest a concerted mechanism for the melting of origin {DNA} that requires structural deformation of the intervening {DNA.}},

Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains elusive whether the "secondary channel" is the only route for {NTP} to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the "main channel" could be an alternative. On this regard, crystallographic structures of Pol {II} have been extremely useful to understand the structural basis of transcription, however, the conformation of the unpaired non-template {DNA} part of the full transcription bubble {(TB)} is still unknown. Since diffusion routes of the nucleoside triphosphate {(NTP)} substrate through the main channel might overlap with the {TB} region, gaining structural information of the full {TB} is critical for a complete understanding of Pol {II} transcription process. In this study, we have built a structural model of Pol {II} with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics {(MD)} simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on {NTP} entry pathways. Interestingly, we found that although both channels have enough space to allow {NTP} loading, the percentage of {MD} conformations containing enough space for {NTP} loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on {MD} simulations with {NTP} loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the {NTP} through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the {NTP} and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template {DNA} strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for {NTP} entry during Pol {II} transcription.},

The inherent features of high-throughput sequencing output call for a modelling framework that can account for the spatial dependency between neighboring regions of the genome and the temporal dimension that arises from observing the protein binding process at progressing time points; also, multiple biological/technical replicates of the experiment are usually produced and methods to jointly account for them are needed. Furthermore, the antibodies used in the experiment lead to potentially different immunoprecipitation efficiencies, which can affect the capability of distinguishing between the true signal in the data and the background noise. The statistical procedure proposed consist of a discrete mixture model with an underlying latent Markov random field: the novelty of the model is to allow both spatial and temporal dependency to play a role in determining the latent state of genomic regions involved in the protein binding process, while combining all the information of the replicates available instead of treating them separately. It is also possible to take into account the different antibodies used, in order to obtain better insights of the process and exploit all the biological information available.},

  abstract={Genes from yeast to mammals are frequently subject to non-coding transcription of their antisense strand; however the genome-wide role for antisense transcription remains elusive. As transcription influences chromatin structure, we took a genome-wide approach to assess which chromatin features are associated with nascent antisense transcription, and contrast these with features associated with nascent sense transcription. We describe a distinct chromatin architecture at the promoter and gene body specifically associated with antisense transcription, marked by reduced {H2B} ubiquitination, {H3K36} and {H3K79} trimethylation and increased levels of H3 acetylation, chromatin remodelling enzymes, histone chaperones and histone turnover. The difference in sense transcription between genes with high or low levels of antisense transcription is slight; thus the antisense transcription-associated chromatin state is not simply analogous to a repressed state. Using mutants in which the level of antisense transcription is reduced at {GAL1,} or altered genome-wide, we show that non-coding transcription is associated with high H3 acetylation and H3 levels across the gene, while reducing {H3K36me3.} Set1 is required for these antisense transcription-associated chromatin changes in the gene body. We propose that nascent antisense and sense transcription have fundamentally distinct relationships with chromatin, and that both should be considered canonical features of eukaryotic genes.},

Prior biochemical studies on the Sen1 homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that it can bind and unwind both {DNA} and {RNA,} but the S. pombe protein is not essential and has not been demonstrated to function in transcription. Furthermore, Sen1 from either yeast has not previously been expressed as a recombinant protein, due to its large molecular mass (252 {kDa} in S. cerevisiae). Here, we report the purification and characterization of the {89-kDa} S. cerevisiae Sen1 helicase domain {(Sen1-HD)} produced in Escherichia coli. {Sen1-HD} binds single-stranded {RNA} and {DNA} with similar affinity in the absence of {ATP,} but it binds {RNA} more stably than {DNA} in the presence of {ATP,} apparently due to a slower translocation rate on {RNA.} Translocation occurs in the 5' to 3' direction, as for the S. pombe protein. When purified from E. coli at a moderate salt concentration, {Sen1-HD} was associated with short {RNAs} that are enriched for the trinucleotide repeat {(CAN)4.} We propose that Sen1 binds to {RNAs} and prevents their stable pairing with {DNA,} consistent with in vivo studies by others showing increased R-loop {(RNA/DNA} hybrid) formation when Sen1 activity is impaired by mutations. Our results are consistent with a model in which Sen1 promotes transcription termination by resolving R-loops.},

Replication timing is determined by the timing of replication origin firing, which involves activation of {MCM} helicase complexes loaded at replication origins. Nonetheless, how the timing of such origin firing is regulated remains mysterious. Here, we show that the number of {MCMs} loaded at origins regulates replication timing. We show for the first time in vivo that multiple {MCMs} are loaded at origins. Because early origins have more {MCMs} loaded, they are, on average, more likely to fire early in S phase. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed heterogeneity in origin firing and help to explain how defined replication timing profiles emerge from stochastic origin firing. These results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.},

Furthermore, mutation of the Pcf11 {CID} results in Nrd1 retention on chromatin, delayed degradation of {ncRNA,} and restricted Pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 phosphorylation and {Sen1-Pol} {II} interaction. Finally, the pcf11-13 and sen1-1 mutant phenotypes are very similar, as both accumulate {RNA:DNA} hybrids and display Pol {II} pausing downstream from {NRD} terminators.

  abstract={Previous studies indicate that eukaryotic promoters display a stereotypical chromatin landscape characterized by a well-positioned +1 nucleosome near the transcription start site and an upstream -1 nucleosome that together demarcate a nucleosome-free (or -depleted) region. Here we present evidence that there are two distinct types of promoters distinguished by the resistance of the -1 nucleosome to micrococcal nuclease digestion. These different architectures are characterized by two sequence motifs that are broadly deployed at one set of promoters where a nuclease-sensitive ("fragile") nucleosome forms, but concentrated in a narrower, nucleosome-free region at all other promoters. The {RSC} nucleosome remodeler acts through the motifs to establish stable +1 and -1 nucleosome positions, while binding of a small set of general regulatory (pioneer) factors at fragile nucleosome promoters plays a key role in their destabilization. We propose that the fragile nucleosome promoter architecture is adapted for regulation of highly expressed, growth-related genes.},

  abstract={{DNA} replication is temporally and spatially organized in all eukaryotes, yet the molecular control and biological function of the replication-timing program are unclear. Rif1 is required for normal genome-wide regulation of replication timing, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells, Rif1 coats late-replicating domains and, with Lamin B1, identifies most of the late-replicating genome. Rif1 is an essential determinant of replication timing of {non-Lamin} B1-bound late domains. We further demonstrate that Rif1 defines and restricts the interactions between replication-timing domains during the G1 phase, thereby revealing a function of Rif1 as organizer of nuclear architecture. Rif1 loss affects both number and replication-timing specificity of the interactions between replication-timing domains. In addition, during the S phase, Rif1 ensures that replication of interacting domains is temporally coordinated. In summary, our study identifies Rif1 as the molecular link between nuclear architecture and replication-timing establishment in mammals.},

  abstract={Mechanisms conferring robustness against regulatory variants have been controversial. Previous studies suggested widespread buffering of {RNA} misexpression on protein levels during translation. We do not find evidence that translational buffering is common. Instead, we find extensive buffering at the level of {RNA} expression, exerted through negative feedback regulation acting in trans, which reduces the effect of regulatory variants on gene expression. Our approach is based on a novel experimental design in which allelic differential expression in a yeast hybrid strain is compared to allelic differential expression in a pool of its spores. Allelic differential expression in the hybrid is due to cis-regulatory differences only. Instead, in the pool of spores allelic differential expression is not only due to cis-regulatory differences but also due to local trans effects that include negative feedback. We found that buffering through such local trans regulation is widespread, typically compensating for about 15\% of cis-regulatory effects on individual genes. Negative feedback is stronger not only for essential genes, indicating its functional relevance, but also for genes with low to middle levels of expression, for which tight regulation matters most. We suggest that negative feedback is one mechanism of Waddington's canalization, facilitating the accumulation of genetic variants that might give selective advantage in different environments.},

  abstract={Non-coding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs)} play critical roles in gene regulation. In eukaryotic cells, {ncRNAs} are processed and/or degraded by the nuclear exosome, a ribonuclease complex containing catalytic subunits Dis3 and Rrp6. The {TRAMP} {(Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4} polyadenylation) complex is a critical exosome cofactor in budding yeast that stimulates the exosome to process/degrade {ncRNAs} and human {TRAMP} components have recently been identified. Importantly, mutations in exosome and exosome cofactor genes cause neurodegenerative disease. How the {TRAMP} complex interacts with other exosome cofactors to orchestrate regulation of the exosome is an open question. To identify novel interactions of the {TRAMP} exosome cofactor, we performed a high copy suppressor screen of a thermosensitive air1/2 {TRAMP} mutant. Here, we report that the Nab3 {RNA-binding} protein of the {Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1} {(NNS)} complex is a potent suppressor of {TRAMP} mutants. Unlike Nab3, Nrd1 and Sen1 do not suppress {TRAMP} mutants and Nrd1 binding is not required for Nab3-mediated suppression of {TRAMP} suggesting an independent role for Nab3. Critically, Nab3 decreases {ncRNA} levels in {TRAMP} mutants, Nab3-mediated suppression of air1/2 cells requires the nuclear exosome component, Rrp6, and Nab3 directly binds Rrp6. We extend this analysis to identify a human {RNA} binding protein, {RALY,} which shares identity with Nab3 and can suppress {TRAMP} mutants. These results suggest that Nab3 facilitates {TRAMP} function by recruiting Rrp6 to {ncRNAs} for processing/degradation independent of Nrd1. The data raise the intriguing possibility that Nab3 and Nrd1 can function independently to recruit Rrp6 to {ncRNA} targets, providing combinatorial flexibility in {RNA} processing.},

Where Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 cross-linked broadly to promoter {DNA} in an {RPG-specific} manner and demarcated by general minor groove widening.

Hmo1 dissociated, which was coupled to an upstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, as reflected by the Hmo1 extension and core promoter region. Fhl1 and Hmo1 may create two regulatable and positionally distinct barriers, against which chromatin remodelers position the +1 nucleosome into either an activating or a repressive state. Consistent with in vitro studies, we found that specific {TFIID} subunits, in addition to cross-linking at the core promoter, made precise cross-links at Rap1 sites, which we interpret to reflect native {Rap1-TFIID} interactions.

Early reports indicate that {5fC} and {5caC} could be stably detected on enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, with distinct effects on gene expression, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we determined the X-ray crystal structure of yeast elongating {RNA} polymerase {II} {(Pol} {II)} in complex with a {DNA} template containing oxidized {5mCs,} revealing specific hydrogen bonds between the 5-carboxyl group of {5caC} and the conserved {epi-DNA} recognition loop in the polymerase. This causes a positional shift for incoming nucleoside 5'-triphosphate {(NTP),} thus compromising nucleotide addition. To test the implication of this structural insight in vivo, we determined the global effect of increased {5fC/5caC} levels on transcription, finding that such {DNA} modifications indeed retarded Pol {II} elongation on gene bodies. These results demonstrate the functional impact of oxidized {5mCs} on gene expression and suggest a novel role for Pol {II} as a specific and direct epigenetic sensor during transcription elongation.},

  abstract={Yeast Npl3 is a highly abundant, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, {RNA-binding} protein, related to metazoan {SR} proteins. Reported functions of Npl3 include transcription elongation, splicing and {RNA} 3' end processing. We used {UV} crosslinking and analysis of {cDNA} {(CRAC)} to map precise {RNA} binding sites, and strand-specific tiling arrays to look at the effects of loss of Npl3 on all transcripts across the genome. We found that Npl3 binds diverse {RNA} species, both coding and non-coding, at sites indicative of roles in both early {pre-mRNA} processing and 3' end formation. Tiling arrays and {RNAPII} mapping data revealed 3' extended {RNAPII-transcribed} {RNAs} in the absence of Npl3, suggesting that defects in {pre-mRNA} packaging events result in termination readthrough. Transcription readthrough was widespread and frequently resulted in down-regulation of neighboring genes. We conclude that the absence of Npl3 results in widespread 3' extension of transcripts with pervasive effects on gene expression.},

  abstract={A new {DNA} aptamer targeting Protein A is presented. The aptamer was selected by use of the {FluMag-SELEX} procedure. The {SELEX} technology {(Systematic} Evolution of Ligands by {EXponential} enrichment) is widely applied as an in vitro selection and amplification method to generate target-specific aptamers and exists in various modified variants. {FluMag-SELEX} is one of them and is characterized by the use of magnetic beads for target immobilization and fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides for monitoring the aptamer selection progress. Structural investigations and sequence truncation experiments of the selected aptamer for Protein A led to the conclusion, that a stem-loop structure at its 5'-end including the 5'-primer binding site is essential for aptamer-target binding. Extensive interaction analyses between aptamer and Protein A were performed by methods like surface plasmon resonance, {MicroScale} Thermophoresis and bead-based binding assays using fluorescence measurements. The binding of the aptamer to its target was thus investigated in assays with immobilization of one of the binding partners each, and with both binding partners in solution. Affinity constants were determined in the low micromolar to submicromolar range, increasing to the nanomolar range under the assumption of avidity. Protein A provides more than one binding site for the aptamer, which may overlap with the known binding sites for immunoglobulins. The aptamer binds specifically to both native and recombinant Protein A, but not to other immunoglobulin-binding proteins like Protein G and L. Cross specificity to other proteins was not found. The application of the aptamer is directed to Protein A detection or affinity purification. Moreover, whole cells of Staphylococcus aureus, presenting Protein A on the cell surface, could also be bound by the aptamer.},

  abstract={There is an increasing interest in complementing {RNA-seq} experiments with {small-RNA} {(sRNA)} expression data to obtain a comprehensive view of a transcriptome. Currently, two main experimental challenges concerning {sRNA-seq} exist: how to check the size distribution of isolated {sRNAs,} given the sensitive size-selection steps in the protocol; and how to normalize data between samples, given the low complexity of {sRNA} types. We here present two separate sets of synthetic {RNA} spike-ins for monitoring size-selection and for performing data normalization in {sRNA-seq.} The size-range quality control {(SRQC)} spike-in set, consisting of 11 oligoribonucleotides (10-70 nucleotides), was tested by intentionally altering the size-selection protocol and verified via several comparative experiments. We demonstrate that the {SRQC} set is useful to reproducibly track down biases in the size-selection in {sRNA-seq.} The external reference for data-normalization {(ERDN)} spike-in set, consisting of 19 oligoribonucleotides, was developed for sample-to-sample normalization in differential-expression analysis of {sRNA-seq} data. Testing and applying the {ERDN} set showed that it can reproducibly detect differential expression over a dynamic range of 2(18). Hence, biological variation in {sRNA} composition and content between samples is preserved while technical variation is effectively minimized. Together, both spike-in sets can significantly improve the technical reproducibility of {sRNA-seq.}},

In vitro transcription analysis and mapping of nascent transcripts in {HeLa} cells revealed that sequences at reverse start sites are similar to those of their forward counterparts. The use of {DNase} I accessibility to define proximal promoter borders revealed that about half of promoters are unidirectional and that unidirectional promoters are depleted at their upstream edges of reverse core promoter sequences and their associated chromatin features. Divergent transcription is thus not an inherent property of the transcription process but rather the consequence of the presence of both forward- and reverse-directed core promoters.},

  abstract={The sequencing of the full transcriptome {(RNA-seq)} has become the preferred choice for the measurement of genome-wide gene expression. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain in {RNA-seq} data analysis. One often-overlooked aspect is normalization. Despite the fact that a variety of factors or 'batch effects' can contribute unwanted variation to the data, commonly used {RNA-seq} normalization methods only correct for sequencing depth. The study of gene expression is particularly problematic when it is influenced simultaneously by a variety of biological factors in addition to the one of interest. Using examples from experimental neuroscience, we show that batch effects can dominate the signal of interest; and that the choice of normalization method affects the power and reproducibility of the results. While commonly used global normalization methods are not able to adequately normalize the data, more recently developed {RNA-seq} normalization can. We focus on one particular method, {RUVSeq} and show that it is able to increase power and biological insight of the results. Finally, we provide a tutorial outlining the implementation of {RUVSeq} normalization that is applicable to a broad range of studies as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data.},

Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the {H2A.Z-H2B} dimer, is essential for activation of {SWR1.} We found that {SWR1} primarily recognizes key residues within the {\&\#x3B1;2} helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone {H2A,} a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, {SWR1} interacts preferentially with nucleosomal {DNA} at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site.

To reveal how the chromatin architecture modulates origin selection and activation, we "footprinted" nucleosomes, transcription factors, and replication proteins at multiple points during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Our nucleotide-resolution protein occupancy profiles resolved a precise {ORC-dependent} footprint at 269 origins in G2. A separate class of inefficient origins exhibited protein occupancy only in G1, suggesting that stable {ORC} chromatin association in G2 is a determinant of origin efficiency. G1 nucleosome remodeling concomitant with {pre-RC} assembly expanded the origin nucleosome-free region and enhanced activation efficiency. Finally, the local chromatin environment restricts the loading of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer either upstream of or downstream from the {ARS} consensus sequence {(ACS).}},

This point of view covers redundant mechanisms of transcription termination and how they relate to conventional termination models.

In addition, mapping the 3' ends of {RNA} molecules to the genome after high-throughput sequencing is challenging, particularly if the 3' ends contain post-transcriptional modifications. To address these problems, we developed {EnD-Seq,} a high-throughput sequencing protocol that preserves the 3' end of {RNA} molecules, and {AppEnD,} a computational method for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Together these allow determination of the 3' ends of {RNA} molecules, including nontemplated additions. Applying {EnD-Seq} and {AppEnD} to histone {mRNAs} revealed that a significant fraction of cytoplasmic histone {mRNAs} end in one or two uridines, which have replaced the 1-2 nt at the 3' end of mature histone {mRNA} maintaining the length of the histone transcripts. Histone {mRNAs} in fly embryos and ovaries show the same pattern, but with different tail nucleotide compositions. We increase the sensitivity of {EnD-Seq} by using {cDNA} priming to specifically enrich low-abundance tails of known sequence composition allowing identification of degradation intermediates. In addition, we show the broad applicability of our computational approach by using {AppEnD} to gain insight into 3' additions from diverse types of sequencing data, including data from small capped {RNA} sequencing and some alternative polyadenylation protocols.},

  abstract={The torpedo model of transcription termination asserts that the exonuclease Xrn2 attacks the {5'PO4-end} exposed by nascent {RNA} cleavage and chases down the {RNA} polymerase. We tested this mechanism using a dominant-negative human Xrn2 mutant and found that it delayed termination genome-wide. Xrn2 nuclease inactivation caused strong termination defects downstream of most {poly(A)} sites and modest delays at some histone and U {snRNA} genes, suggesting that the torpedo mechanism is not limited to {poly(A)} site-dependent termination. A central untested feature of the torpedo model is that there is kinetic competition between the exonuclease and the pol {II} elongation complex. Using pol {II} rate mutants, we found that slow transcription robustly shifts termination upstream, and fast elongation extends the zone of termination further downstream. These results suggest that kinetic competition between elongating pol {II} and the Xrn2 exonuclease is integral to termination of transcription on most human genes.},

Here we show that yeast {TFIIH} contains an Ssl2-dependent double-stranded {DNA} translocase activity. Ssl2 tracks along one {DNA} strand in the 5' \&\#x2192; 3' direction, implying it uses the nontemplate promoter strand to reel downstream {DNA} into the Pol {II} cleft, creating torsional strain and leading to {DNA} unwinding. Analysis of the Ssl2 and {DNA-dependent} {ATPase} activity of {TFIIH} suggests that Ssl2 has a processivity of approximately one {DNA} turn, consistent with the length of {DNA} unwound during transcription initiation. Our results can explain why maintaining the {OC} requires continuous {ATP} hydrolysis and the function of {TFIIH} in promoter escape.

  abstract={Centromeres are the chromosomal regions promoting kinetochore assembly for chromosome segregation. In many eukaryotes, the centromere consists of up to mega base pairs of {DNA.} On such "regional centromeres," kinetochore assembly is mainly defined {by\&\#xA0;epigenetic} regulation [1]. By contrast, a clade of budding yeasts {(Saccharomycetaceae)} has a "point centromere" of 120-200 base pairs of {DNA,} on which kinetochore assembly is defined by the consensus {DNA} sequence [2, 3]. During evolution, budding yeasts acquired point centromeres, which replaced ancestral, regional centromeres [4]. All known point centromeres among different yeast species share common consensus {DNA} elements {(CDEs)} [5, 6], implying that they evolved only once and stayed essentially unchanged throughout evolution. Here, we identify a yeast centromere that challenges this view: that of the budding yeast Naumovozyma castellii is the first unconventional point centromere with unique {CDEs.} The {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} centromere {CDEs} are essential for centromere function but have different {DNA} sequences from {CDEs} in other point centromeres. Gene order analyses around {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} centromeres indicate their unique, and separate, evolutionary origin. Nevertheless, they are still bound by the ortholog of the {CBF3} complex, which recognizes {CDEs} in other point centromeres. The new type of point centromere originated prior to the divergence between {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} and its close relative Naumovozyma dairenensis and disseminated to all {N.\&\#xA0;castellii} chromosomes through extensive genome rearrangement. Thus, contrary to the conventional view, point centromeres can undergo rapid evolutionary changes. These findings give new insights into the evolution of point centromeres.},

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis {(PCA)} are common approaches for dealing with this onslaught. Though these unsupervised techniques can help uncover interesting structure in high-dimensional data they give little insight into the biological and technical considerations that might explain the uncovered structure. Here we introduce a hybrid approach-component selection using mutual information {(CSUMI)-that} uses a mutual information-based statistic to reinterpret the results of {PCA} in a biologically meaningful way. We apply {CSUMI} to {RNA-seq} data from {GTEx.} Our hybrid approach enables us to unveil the previously hidden relationship between principal components {(PCs)} and the underlying biological and technical sources of variation across samples. In particular, we look at how tissue type affects {PCs} beyond the first two, allowing us to devise a principled way of choosing which {PCs} to consider when exploring the data. We further apply our method to {RNA-seq} data taken from the brain and show that some of the most biologically informative {PCs} are higher-dimensional {PCs;} for instance, {PC} 5 can differentiate the basal ganglia from other tissues. We also use {CSUMI} to explore how technical artifacts affect the global structure of the data, validating previous results and demonstrating how our method can be viewed as a verification framework for detecting undiscovered biases in emerging technologies. Finally we compare {CSUMI} to two correlation-based approaches, showing ours outperforms both. A python implementation is available online on the {CSUMI} website.},

We have also detected relatively long putative premature {RNA} polymerase {II} termination products of protein-coding genes whose levels in {DIS3} mutant cells can exceed the mature {mRNAs,} indicating that production of such truncated {RNA} is a common phenomenon. In addition, we found {DIS3} to be involved in controlling the formation of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that are organized around {NEAT1} {lncRNA,} whose short form was overexpressed in cells with mutated {DIS3.} Moreover, the {DIS3} mutations resulted in misregulation of expression of {\&\#x223C;50\%} of transcribed protein-coding genes, probably as a secondary effect of accumulation of various noncoding {RNA} species. Finally, cells expressing mutant {DIS3} accumulated {snoRNA} precursors, which correlated with a strong {PAR-CLIP} signal, indicating that {DIS3} is the main {snoRNA-processing} enzyme. {EXOSC10} {(RRP6)} instead controls the levels of the mature {snoRNAs.} Overall, we show that {DIS3} has a major nucleoplasmic function in shaping the human {RNA} polymerase {II} transcriptome.},

In contrast, the extent of pol {II} {CTD} Ser2 phosphorylation did not closely correlate with {poly(A)} site selection.

Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

  abstract={Transcription factor {(TF)} binding is determined by the presence of specific sequence motifs {(SM)} and chromatin accessibility, where the latter is influenced by both chromatin state {(CS)} and {DNA} structure {(DS)} properties. Although {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} have been used to predict {TF} binding sites, a predictive model that jointly considers {CS} and {DS} has not been developed to predict either {TF-specific} binding or general binding properties of {TFs.} Using budding yeast as model, we found that machine learning classifiers trained with either {CS} or {DS} features alone perform better in predicting {TF-specific} binding compared to {SM-based} classifiers. In addition, simultaneously considering {CS} and {DS} further improves the accuracy of the {TF} binding predictions, indicating the highly complementary nature of these two properties. The contributions of {SM,} {CS,} and {DS} features to binding site predictions differ greatly between {TFs,} allowing {TF-specific} predictions and potentially reflecting different {TF} binding mechanisms. In addition, a {"TF-agnostic"} predictive model based on three {DNA} "intrinsic properties" (in silico predicted nucleosome occupancy, major groove geometry, and dinucleotide free energy) that can be calculated from genomic sequences alone has performance that rivals the model incorporating experiment-derived data. This intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions not only across {TFs,} but also across {DNA-binding} domain families with distinct structural folds. Furthermore, these predicted binding regions can help identify {TF} binding sites that have a significant impact on target gene expression. Because the intrinsic property model allows prediction of binding regions across {DNA-binding} domain families, it is {TF} agnostic and likely describes general binding potential of {TFs.} Thus, our findings suggest that it is feasible to establish a {TF} agnostic model for identifying functional regulatory regions in potentially any sequenced genome.},

  abstract={The particular behaviour of eukaryotic {RNA} polymerases along different gene regions and amongst distinct gene functional groups is not totally understood. To cast light onto the alternative active or backtracking states of {RNA} polymerase {II,} we have quantitatively mapped active {RNA} polymerases at a high resolution following a new biotin-based genomic run-on {(BioGRO)} technique. Compared with conventional profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation, the analysis of the {BioGRO} profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that {RNA} polymerase {II} has unique activity profiles at both gene ends, which are highly dependent on positioned nucleosomes. This is the first demonstration of the in vivo influence of positioned nucleosomes on transcription elongation. The particular features at the 5' end and around the polyadenylation site indicate that this polymerase undergoes extensive specific-activity regulation in the initial and final transcription elongation phases. The genes encoding for ribosomal proteins show distinctive features at both ends. {BioGRO} also provides the first nascentome analysis for {RNA} polymerase {III,} which indicates that transcription of {tRNA} genes is poorly regulated at the individual copy level. The present study provides a novel perspective of the transcription cycle that incorporates inactivation/reactivation as an important aspect of {RNA} polymerase dynamics.},

To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide, we used {H4S47C-anchored} cleavage mapping, which revealed that 5\% of budding yeast {(Saccharomyces} cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric {histone-DNA} interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease {(MNase)} sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in {MNase} protection near the dyad axis, suggesting that the loss of {DNA} contacts around {H4S47} is accompanied by protection of the {DNA} from {MNase.} Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the {RSC} chromatin remodeling complex, which is required for maintaining nucleosomes at asymmetric positions.

  abstract={The hepatitis B virus {(HBV)} particle is an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope containing viral surface proteins. A small domain (matrix domain, {MD)} in the large surface protein L and a narrow region (matrix binding domain, {MBD)} including isoleucine 126 on the capsid surface have been mapped where point mutations like {core-I126A} specifically blocked nucleocapsid envelopment. Possibly, both domains interact with each other during virion morphogenesis. By the {SELEX} method we evolved {DNA} aptamers from an oligonucleotide library binding to purified recombinant capsids but not binding to the corresponding {I126A} mutant capsids. Aptamers bound to capsids were separated from unbound molecules by filtration. After 13 rounds of selections and amplifications 16 different aptamers were found among 73 clones. The four most frequent aptamers represented more than 50 \% of the clones. The main aptamer {AO-01} (13 clones, 18 \%) showed the lowest dissociation constant {(Kd)} of 180 +/- 82 {nM} for capsid binding among the four molecules. Its Kd value for {I126A} capsids was 1306 +/- 503 {nM.} Cotransfection of Huh7 cells with {AO-01} and an {HBV} genomic construct resulted in 47 \% inhibition of virion production 3 days post transfection but showed no inhibition by cotransfection of an aptamer with random sequence. The half-life of {AO-01} in cells was 2 hours which might explain the incomplete inhibition. The results support the importance of the {MBD} for nucleocapsid envelopment. Inhibiting the {MD-MBD} interaction by a low molecular weight substance might represent a new approach for an antiviral therapy.},

Nab3 and Nrd1 are {hnRNP-like} proteins that dimerize and bind {RNA} with sequence specificity. We show here that an essential region of Nab3 that is predicted to be prion-like based upon its sequence bias, formed amyloid-like filaments. A similar region from Nrd1 also assembled into filaments in vitro. The purified Nab3 domain formed a macroscopic gel whose lattice organization was observed by X-ray fiber diffraction. Filaments were resistant to dissociation in anionic detergent, bound the fluorescent dye thioflavin T, and showed a {\&\#x3B2;-sheet} rich structure by circular dichroism spectroscopy, similar to human amyloid {\&\#x3B2;} which served as a reference amyloid. A version of the Nab3 domain with a mutation that impairs its termination function, also formed fibers as observed by electron microscopy. Using a protein fragment interaction assay, the purified Nab3 domain was seen to interact with itself in living yeast. A similar observation was made for full length Nab3. These results suggest that the Nab3 and Nrd1 {RNA-binding} proteins can attain a complex polymeric form and raise the possibility that this property is important for organizing their functional state during termination. These findings are congruent with recent work showing that {RNA} binding proteins with low complexity domains form a dynamic subcellular matrix in which {RNA} metabolism takes place but can also aberrantly yield pathological aggregated particles.},

To investigate their potential as target-specific agonists, we used {SELEX} to generate aptamers to the insulin receptor {(IR)} and identified an agonistic aptamer named {IR-A48} that specifically binds to {IR,} but not to {IGF-1} receptor. Despite its capacity to stimulate {IR} autophosphorylation, similar to insulin, we found that {IR-A48} not only binds to an allosteric site distinct from the insulin binding site, but also preferentially induces Y1150 phosphorylation in the {IR} kinase domain. Moreover, Y1150-biased phosphorylation induced by {IR-A48} selectively activates specific signaling pathways downstream of {IR.} In contrast to insulin-mediated activation of {IR,} {IR-A48} binding has little effect on the {MAPK} pathway and proliferation of cancer cells. Instead, {AKT} S473 phosphorylation is highly stimulated by {IR-A48,} resulting in increased glucose uptake both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present {IR-A48} as a biased agonist able to selectively induce the metabolic activity of {IR} through allosteric binding.

  abstract={Transcriptional regulation requires the binding of transcription factors {(TFs)} to short sequence-specific {DNA} motifs, usually located at the gene regulatory regions. Interestingly, based on a vast amount of data accumulated from genomic assays, it has been shown that only a small fraction of all potential binding sites containing the consensus motif of a given {TF} actually bind the protein. Recent in vitro binding assays, which exclude the effects of the cellular environment, also demonstrate selective {TF} binding. An intriguing conjecture is that the surroundings of cognate binding sites have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other sequences containing a similar motif that are not bound by the {TF.} To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and {DNA} shape features surrounding the core-binding sites of 239 and 56 {TFs} extracted from in vitro {HT-SELEX} binding assays and in vivo {ChIP-seq} data, respectively. Comparing the nucleotide content of the regions around the {TF-bound} sites to the counterpart unbound regions containing the same consensus motifs revealed significant differences that extend far beyond the core-binding site. Specifically, the environment of the bound motifs demonstrated unique sequence compositions, {DNA} shape features, and overall high similarity to the core-binding motif. Notably, the regions around the binding sites of {TFs} that belong to the same {TF} families exhibited similar features, with high agreement between the in vitro and in vivo data sets. We propose that these unique features assist in guiding {TFs} to their cognate binding sites.},

  abstract={In eukaryotes, the precise transcriptional control of gene expression is typically achieved through combinatorial regulation using cooperative transcription factors {(TFs).} Therefore, a database which provides regulatory associations between cooperative {TFs} and their target genes is helpful for biologists to study the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Because there is no such kind of databases in the public domain, this prompts us to construct a database, called Yeast Combinatorial Regulation Database {(YCRD),} which deposits 434,197 regulatory associations between 2535 cooperative {TF} pairs and 6243 genes. The comprehensive collection of more than 2500 cooperative {TF} pairs was retrieved from 17 existing algorithms in the literature. The target genes of a cooperative {TF} pair (e.g. {TF1-TF2)} are defined as the common target genes of {TF1} and {TF2,} where a {TF's} experimentally validated target genes were downloaded from {YEASTRACT} database. In {YCRD,} users can (i) search the target genes of a cooperative {TF} pair of interest, (ii) search the cooperative {TF} pairs which regulate a gene of interest and (iii) identify important cooperative {TF} pairs which regulate a given set of genes. We believe that {YCRD} will be a valuable resource for yeast biologists to study combinatorial regulation of gene expression. {YCRD} is available at {http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YCRD/} or {http://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YCRD/.}},

  abstract={To prevent rereplication of genomic segments, the eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into two nonoverlapping phases. During late mitosis and G1 replication origins are "licensed" by loading {MCM2-7} double hexamers and during S phase licensed replication origins activate to initiate bidirectional replication forks. Replication forks can stall irreversibly, and if two converging forks stall with no intervening licensed origin-a "double fork stall" {(DFS)-replication} cannot be completed by conventional means. We previously showed how the distribution of replication origins in yeasts promotes complete genome replication even in the presence of irreversible fork stalling. This analysis predicts that {DFSs} are rare in yeasts but highly likely in large mammalian genomes. Here we show that complementary strand synthesis in early mitosis, ultrafine anaphase bridges, and G1-specific p53-binding protein 1 {(53BP1)} nuclear bodies provide a mechanism for resolving unreplicated {DNA} at {DFSs} in human cells. When origin number was experimentally altered, the number of these structures closely agreed with theoretical predictions of {DFSs.} The {53BP1} is preferentially bound to larger replicons, where the probability of {DFSs} is higher. Loss of {53BP1} caused hypersensitivity to licensing inhibition when replication origins were removed. These results provide a striking convergence of experimental and theoretical evidence that unreplicated {DNA} can pass through mitosis for resolution in the following cell cycle.},

This induces critical conformational changes in the heart of the enzyme that trigger termination.

Although we found that {TSS} scanning does not require {RNA} synthesis, our results revealed that transcription in the purified yeast basal system is largely {ATP-independent} despite a requirement for the {TFIIH} {DNA} translocase subunit Ssl2. This result is rationalized by our finding that, although they are poorer substrates, {UTP} and {GTP} can also be utilized by Ssl2. {ATP\&\#x3B3;S} is a strong inhibitor of {rNTP-fueled} translocation, and high concentrations of {ATP\&\#x3B3;S} make transcription completely dependent on added {dATP.} Limiting Pol {II} function with low {ATP} concentrations shifted the {TSS} position downstream.

  abstract={In yeast, inducible genes such as {INO1,} {PRM1} and {HIS4} reposition from the nucleoplasm to nuclear periphery upon activation. This leads to a physical interaction with nuclear pore complex {(NPC),} interchromosomal clustering, and stronger transcription. Repositioning to the nuclear periphery is controlled by cis-acting transcription factor {(TF)} binding sites located within the promoters of these genes and the {TFs} that bind to them. Such elements are both necessary and sufficient to control positioning of genes to the nuclear periphery. We have identified 4 {TFs} capable of controlling the regulated positioning of genes to the nuclear periphery in budding yeast under different conditions: Put3, Cbf1, Gcn4 and Ste12. In each case, we have defined the molecular basis of regulated relocalization to the nuclear periphery. Put3- and Cbf1-mediated targeting to nuclear periphery is regulated through local recruitment of {Rpd3(L)} histone deacetylase complex by transcriptional repressors. {Rpd3(L),} through its histone deacetylase activity, prevents {TF-mediated} gene positioning by blocking {TF} binding. Many yeast transcriptional repressors were capable of blocking Put3-mediated recruitment; 11 of these required Rpd3. Thus, it is a general function of transcription repressors to regulate {TF-mediated} recruitment. However, Ste12 and Gcn4-mediated recruitment is regulated independently of {Rpd3(L)} and transcriptional repressors. Ste12-mediated recruitment is regulated by phosphorylation of an inhibitor called Dig2, and Gcn4-mediated gene targeting is up-regulated by increasing Gcn4 protein levels. The ability to control spatial position of genes in yeast represents a novel function for {TFs} and different regulatory strategies provide dynamic control of the yeast genome through different time scales.},

  abstract={Eukaryotic promoters generally contain nucleosome depleted regions near their transcription start sites. In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these regions are adjacent to binding sites for general regulatory transcription factors, and the Reb1 protein is commonly bound to promoter {DNA} near such regions. The yeast {TFC6} promoter is a unique {RNA} polymerase {II} promoter in that it is autoregulated by its own gene product Tfc6p, which is part of the {RNA} polymerase {III} transcription factor complex {TFIIIC.} We previously demonstrated that mutation of a potential Reb1 binding site adjacent to the {TFIIIC} binding site in the {TFC6} promoter modestly reduces transcript levels, but leads to a severe decrease in Tfc6 protein levels due to an upstream shift in the {TFC6} transcription start site. Here we confirm that Reb1p indeed binds to the {TFC6} promoter, and is important for proper transcription start site selection and protein expression. Interestingly, loss of Reb1p association at this site has a similar effect on the adjacent divergently transcribed {ESC2} promoter, resulting in a significant increase of 5'-extended {ESC2} transcripts and reduction of Esc2 protein levels. This altered divergent transcription may be the result of changes in nucleosome positioning at this locus in the absence of Reb1p binding. We speculate that an important function of general regulatory factors such as Reb1p is to establish and maintain proper transcription start sites at promoters, and that when binding of such factors is compromised, resulting effects on {mRNA} translation may be an underappreciated aspect of gene regulation studies.},

Here we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog of Nrd1, Seb1, does not function in {NNS-like} termination but promotes polyadenylation site selection of coding and noncoding genes. We found that Seb1 associates with 3' end processing factors, is enriched at the 3' end of genes, and binds {RNA} motifs downstream from cleavage sites. Importantly, a deficiency in Seb1 resulted in widespread changes in 3' untranslated region {(UTR)} length as a consequence of increased alternative polyadenylation.

  abstract={Transcription is a fundamental process that is tightly regulated by transcription factors to maintain cellular homeostasis. Transcription factors have {DNA-binding} domains, some of which are sequence specific, and are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. Recent studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms by which transcription factors perform their functions. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rap1 {(ScRap1)} can either activate or repress transcription. This bimodal transcriptional activity has led to the widespread study of the mode of action of {ScRap1.} This review summarizes current knowledge about yeast {ScRap1,} including its structure, mechanisms of transcription regulation, and biological functions, and the future directions in the field.},

  abstract={Fitness landscapes describe the genotype-fitness relationship and represent major determinants of evolutionary trajectories. However, the vast genotype space, coupled with the difficulty of measuring fitness, has hindered the empirical determination of fitness landscapes. Combining precise gene replacement and next-generation sequencing, we quantified Darwinian fitness under a high-temperature challenge for more than 65,000 yeast strains, each carrying a unique variant of the single-copy {tRNA(CCU)(Arg)} gene at its native genomic location. Approximately 1\% of single point mutations in the gene were beneficial and 42\% were deleterious. Almost half of all mutation pairs exhibited statistically significant epistasis, which had a strong negative bias, except when the mutations occurred at {Watson-Crick} paired sites. Fitness was broadly correlated with the predicted fraction of correctly folded transfer {RNA} {(tRNA)} molecules, thereby revealing a biophysical basis of the fitness landscape.},

  abstract={{CCR4-NOT} is a large protein complex present both in cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Although it is involved in a variety of distinct processes related to expression of genetic information such as {poly(A)} tail shortening, transcription regulation, nuclear export and protein degradation, there is only fragmentary information available on some of its nine subunits. Here we show a comprehensive structural characterization of the native {CCR4-NOT} complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our {cryo-EM} {3D} reconstruction of the complex, combined with techniques such as immunomicroscopy, {RNA-nanogold} labelling, docking of the available high-resolution structures and models of different subunits and domains, allow us to propose its full molecular architecture. We locate all functionally defined domains endowed with deadenylating and ubiquitinating activities, the nucleus-specific {RNA-interacting} subunit Mmi1, as well as surfaces responsible for protein-protein interactions. This information provides insight into cooperation of the different {CCR4-NOT} complex functions.},

  abstract={Telomeres are important for maintaining the integrity of the genome through the action of the shelterin complex. Previous studies indicted that the length of the telomere did not have an effect on the amount of the shelterin subunits; however, those experiments were performed using immortalized cells with stable telomere lengths. The interest of the present study was to observe how decreasing telomere lengths over successive generations would affect the shelterin subunits. As neonatal human dermal fibroblasts aged and their telomeres became shorter, the levels of the telomere-binding protein telomeric repeat factor 2 {(TRF2)} decreased significantly. By contrast, the levels of one of its binding partners, repressor/activator protein 1 {(RAP1),} decreased to a lesser extent than would be expected from the decrease in {TRF2.} Other subunits, {TERF1-interacting} nuclear factor 2 and protection of telomeres protein 1, remained stable. The decrease in {RAP1} in the older cells occurred in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Hydrogen peroxide {(H2O2)} stress was used as an artificial means of aging in the cells, and this resulted in {RAP1} levels decreasing, but the effect was only observed in the nuclear portion. Similar results were obtained using U251 glioblastoma cells treated with {H2O2} or grown in serum-depleted medium. The present findings indicate that {TRF2} and {RAP1} levels decrease as fibroblasts naturally age. {RAP1} remains more stable compared to {TRF2.} {RAP1} also responds to oxidative stress, but the response is different to that observed in aging.},

Telomeres are replicated by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein {(RNP)} reverse transcriptase, and are maintained primarily by nucleoprotein complexes such as shelterin {(TRF1,} {TRF2,} {TIN2,} {RAP1,} {POT1,} {TPP1)} and {CST} {(Cdc13/Ctc1,} Stn1, Ten1). The focus of this review is on the {CST} complex and its role in telomere maintenance. Although initially thought to be unique to yeast, it is now evident that the {CST} complex is present in a diverse range of organisms where it contributes to genome maintenance. The {CST} accomplishes these tasks via telomere capping and by regulating telomerase and {DNA} polymerase alpha-primase {(pol\&\#x3B1;-primase)} access to telomeres, a process closely coordinated with the shelterin complex in most organisms. The goal of this review is to provide a brief but comprehensive account of the diverse, and in some cases organism-dependent, functions of the {CST} complex and how it contributes to telomere maintenance and cell proliferation.},

Here, we used single-molecule {FRET} to monitor the remodeling of mononucleosomes by the yeast {SWI/SNF} remodeler, {RSC.} We observed that {RSC} primarily translocates {DNA} around the nucleosome without substantial displacement of the {H2A-H2B} dimer. At the sites where {DNA} enters and exits the nucleosome, the {DNA} moves largely along or near its canonical wrapping path. The translocation of {DNA} occurs in a stepwise manner, and at both sites where {DNA} enters and exits the nucleosome, the step size distributions exhibit a peak at approximately 1-2 bp.

  abstract={{SMC} proteins constitute the core members of the Smc5/6, cohesin and condensin complexes. We demonstrate that Smc5/6 is present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle and its association with chromosome ends is dependent on Nse3, a subcomponent of the complex. Cells harboring a temperature sensitive mutant, nse3-1, are defective in Smc5/6 localization to telomeres and have slightly shorter telomeres. Nse3 interacts physically and genetically with two Rap1-binding factors, Rif2 and Sir4. Reduction in telomere-associated Smc5/6 leads to defects in telomere clustering, dispersion of the silencing factor, Sir4, and a loss in transcriptional repression for sub-telomeric genes and non-coding telomeric repeat-containing {RNA} {(TERRA).} {SIR4} recovery at telomeres is reduced in cells lacking Smc5/6 functionality and vice versa. However, nse3-1/ sir4 \&\#x394; double mutants show additive defects for telomere shortening and {TPE} indicating the contribution of Smc5/6 to telomere homeostasis is only in partial overlap with {SIR} factor silencing. These findings support a role for Smc5/6 in telomere maintenance that is separate from its canonical role(s) in {HR-mediated} events during replication and telomere elongation.},

  abstract={Structural dynamics of a protein molecule is often critical to its function. Single-molecule methods provide efficient ways to investigate protein dynamics, although it is very challenging to achieve a millisecond or higher temporal resolution. Here we report spontaneous structural dynamics of the histone protein core in the nucleosome based on a single-molecule method that can reveal submillisecond dynamics by combining maximum likelihood estimation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The nucleosome, comprising {\&\#x223C;147} bp {DNA} and an octameric histone protein core consisting of {H2A,} {H2B,} H3, and H4, is the fundamental packing unit of the eukaryotic genome. The nucleosome imposes a physical barrier that should be overcome during various {DNA-templated} processes. Structural fluctuation of the nucleosome in the histone core has been hypothesized to be required for nucleosome disassembly but has yet to be directly probed. Our results indicate that at 100 {mM} {NaCl} the histone {H2A-H2B} dimer dissociates from the histone core transiently once every 3.6 {\&\#xB1;} 0.6 ms and returns to its position within 2.0 {\&\#xB1;} 0.3 ms. We also found that the motion is facilitated upon {H3K56} acetylation and inhibited upon replacing {H2A} with {H2A.Z.} These results provide the first direct examples of how a localized post-translational modification or an epigenetic variation affects the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities of a macromolecular protein complex, which may directly contribute to its functions.},

Unlike Rad26, which becomes completely dispensable for {TCR} in cells lacking the {TCR} repressor Spt4, Sen1 is still required for efficient {TCR} in the absence of Spt4.

We address {ORC} binding selectivity in vivo by mapping {\&\#x223C;52,000} {ORC2} binding sites throughout the human genome. The {ORC} binding profile is broader than those of sequence-specific transcription factors, suggesting that {ORC} is not bound or recruited to specific {DNA} sequences. Instead, {ORC} binds nonspecifically to open {(DNase} I-hypersensitive) regions containing active chromatin marks such as H3 acetylation and {H3K4} methylation. {ORC} sites in early and late replicating regions have similar properties, but there are far more {ORC} sites in early replicating regions. This suggests that replication timing is due primarily to {ORC} density and stochastic firing of origins. Computational simulation of stochastic firing from identified {ORC} sites is in accord with replication timing data. Large genomic regions with a paucity of {ORC} sites are strongly associated with common fragile sites and recurrent deletions in cancers. We suggest that replication origins, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks are determined primarily by the genomic distribution of activator proteins at enhancers and promoters. These activators recruit nucleosome-modifying complexes to create the appropriate chromatin structure that allows {ORC} binding and subsequent origin firing.},

This paper describes the first selection and identification of {DNA} aptamers able to recognize the biogenic amine tyramine. To successfully isolate aptamers to this challenging small molecule target, the {SELEX} methodology was adapted by combining a systematic strategy to increase the selection stringency and monitor enrichment success. As the benefits of applying high-throughput sequencing {(HTS)} in {SELEX} experiments is becoming more clear, this method was employed in combination with bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the utility of the selection strategy and to uncover new potential high affinity sequences. Based on the presence of consensus regions (sequence families) and family similarities (clusters), 15 putative aptamers to tyramine were identified. A recently described workflow approach to perform a primary screening and characterization of the aptamer candidates by micro-equilibrium dialysis and by microscale thermophoresis was next leveraged. These candidate aptamers exhibited dissociation constant {(Kd)} values in the range of 0.2-152 {\&\#xB5;M} with aptamer Tyr\_10 as the most promising one followed by aptamer Tyr\_14. These aptamers could be used as promising molecular recognition tools for the development of inexpensive, robust and innovative biosensor platforms for the detection of tyramine in food and beverages.},

Once loaded, polymerase either remains in the initiation form (with some probability) or transitions into an elongating form (with the remaining probability). The model can be fit genome-wide, allowing patterns of Pol {II} behavior to be assessed on each distinct transcript. Furthermore, it allows for the first time a principled approach to distinguishing the initiation signal from the elongation signal; in particular, it implies a data driven method for calculating the pausing index, a commonly used metric that informs on the behavior of {RNA} polymerase {II.} We demonstrate that this approach improves on existing analyses of {GRO-seq} data and uncovers a novel biological understanding of the impact of knocking down the Male Specific Lethal {(MSL)} complex in Drosophilia melanogaster.},

Replication initiates stochastically, primarily within non-transcribed, broad (up to 150\&\#x2009;kb) zones that often abut transcribed genes, and terminates dispersively between them. Replication fork progression is significantly co-oriented with the transcription. Initiation and termination zones are frequently contiguous, sometimes separated by regions of unidirectional replication. Initiation zones are enriched in open chromatin and enhancer marks, even when not flanked by genes, and often border 'topologically associating domains' {(TADs).} Initiation zones are enriched in origin recognition complex {(ORC)-binding} sites and better align to origins previously mapped using bubble-trap than {\&\#x3BB;-exonuclease.} This novel panorama of replication reveals how chromatin and transcription modulate the initiation process to create cell-type-specific replication programs.},

Unlike Rap1-associated promoters, the small cohort of Abf1-dependent {RPGs} {(Abf1-RPGs)} has not been extensively investigated. We show that {RPL3,} {RPL4B,} {RPP1A,} {RPS22B} and {RPS28A/B} share a common promoter architecture, with an Abf1 site upstream of a conserved element matching the sequence recognized by Fhl1, a transcription factor which together with Ifh1 orchestrates Rap1-associated {RPG} regulation. Abf1 and Fhl1 promoter association was confirmed by {ChIP} and/or gel retardation assays. Mutational analysis revealed a more severe requirement of Abf1 than Fhl1 binding sites for {RPG} transcription. In the case of {RPS22B} an unusual Tbf1 binding site promoted both {RPS22B} and intron-hosted {SNR44} expression. {Abf1-RPG} down-regulation upon {TOR} pathway inhibition was much attenuated at defective mutant promoters unable to bind Abf1. {TORC1} inactivation caused the expected reduction of Ifh1 occupancy at {RPS22B} and {RPL3} promoters, but unexpectedly it entailed largely increased Abf1 association with {Abf1-RPG} promoters. We present evidence that Abf1 recruitment upon nutritional stress, also observed for representative ribosome biogenesis genes, favours {RPG} transcriptional rescue upon nutrient replenishment, thus pointing to nutrient-regulated Abf1 dynamics at promoters as a novel mechanism in ribosome biogenesis control.},

  abstract={In eukaryotes, the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of Rpb1 contains a heptapeptide repeat sequence of {(Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7)n} that undergoes reversible phosphorylation through the opposing action of kinases and phosphatases. Rtr1 is a conserved protein that colocalizes with {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII)} and has been shown to be important for the transition from elongation to termination during transcription by removing {RNAPII} {CTD} serine 5 phosphorylation {(Ser5-P)} at a selection of target genes. In this study, we show that Rtr1 is a global regulator of the {CTD} code with deletion of {RTR1} causing genome-wide changes in {Ser5-P} {CTD} phosphorylation and cotranscriptional histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation {(H3K36me3).} Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-resolution microarrays, we show that {RTR1} deletion results in global changes in {RNAPII} {Ser5-P} levels on genes with different lengths and transcription rates consistent with its role as a {CTD} phosphatase. Although {Ser5-P} levels increase, the overall occupancy of {RNAPII} either decreases or stays the same in the absence of {RTR1} Additionally, the loss of Rtr1 in vivo leads to increases in {H3K36me3} levels genome-wide, while total histone H3 levels remain relatively constant within coding regions. Overall, these findings suggest that Rtr1 regulates {H3K36me3} levels through changes in the number of binding sites for the histone methyltransferase Set2, thereby influencing both the {CTD} and histone codes.},

Many mutations had small individual effects but had large effects in the context of additional mutations, which indicated negative epistasis.

Origins are localized and can be highly efficient in budding yeast, are randomly located in early fly and frog embryos, which do not transcribe their genomes, and are clustered in broad (10-100 kb) non-transcribed zones, frequently abutting transcribed genes, in mammalian cells. Nonetheless, in all cases, origins are established during the G1-phase of the cell cycle by the loading of double hexamers of the Mcm 2-7 proteins {(MCM} {DHs),} the core of the replicative helicase. {MCM} {DH} activation in S-phase leads to origin unwinding, polymerase recruitment, and initiation of bidirectional {DNA} synthesis. Although {MCM} {DHs} are initially loaded at sites defined by the binding of the origin recognition complex {(ORC),} they ultimately bind chromatin in much greater numbers than {ORC} and only a fraction are activated in any one S-phase. Data suggest that the multiplicity and functional redundancy of {MCM} {DHs} provide robustness to the replication process and affect replication time and that {MCM} {DHs} can slide along the {DNA} and spread over large distances around the {ORC.} Recent studies further show that {MCM} {DHs} are displaced along the {DNA} by collision with transcription complexes but remain functional for initiation after displacement. Therefore, eukaryotic {DNA} replication relies on intrinsically mobile and flexible origins, a strategy fundamentally different from bacteria but conserved from yeast to human. These properties of {MCM} {DHs} likely contribute to the establishment of broad, intergenic replication initiation zones in higher eukaryotes.},

  abstract={{RNA-seq} is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An {RNA-seq} experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially expressed {(SDE)} genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to \&gt;85\% for the subset of {SDE} genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve \&gt;85\% for all {SDE} genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at \&\#x2272;5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their {FDR} adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future {RNA-seq} experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify {SDE} genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances {makesedgeRthe} leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important {andDESeqmarginally} outperforms the other tools.},

  abstract={Recent work suggests that {DNA} replication origins are regulated by the number of multiple mini-chromosome maintenance {(MCM)} complexes loaded. Origins are defined by the loading of {MCM} - the replicative helicase which initiates {DNA} replication and replication kinetics determined by origin's location and firing times. However, activation of {MCM} is heterogeneous; different origins firing at different times in different cells. Also, more {MCMs} are loaded in G1 than are used in S phase. These aspects of {MCM} biology are explained by the observation that multiple {MCMs} are loaded at origins. Having more {MCMs} at early origins makes them more likely to fire, effecting differences in origin efficiency that define replication timing. Nonetheless, multiple {MCM} loading raises new questions, such as how they are loaded, where these {MCMs} reside at origins, and how their presence affects replication timing. In this review, we address these questions and discuss future avenues of research.},

Rather, protein-protein interactions between the {TTD} with the Rpa12 subunit of {RNA} pol I seem to be an integral part of the mechanism.

  abstract={Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} is an important tool for studying gene regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and histones. Peak calling is one of the first steps in the analysis of these data. Peak calling consists of two sub-problems: identifying candidate peaks and testing candidate peaks for statistical significance. We surveyed 30 methods and identified 12 features of the two sub-problems that distinguish methods from each other. We picked six methods {GEM,} {MACS2,} {MUSIC,} {BCP,} Threshold-based method {(TM)} and {ZINBA]} that span this feature space and used a combination of 300 simulated {ChIP-seq} data sets, 3 real data sets and mathematical analyses to identify features of methods that allow some to perform better than the others. We prove that methods that explicitly combine the signals from {ChIP} and input samples are less powerful than methods that do not. Methods that use windows of different sizes are more powerful than the ones that do not. For statistical testing of candidate peaks, methods that use a Poisson test to rank their candidate peaks are more powerful than those that use a Binomial test. {BCP} and {MACS2} have the best operating characteristics on simulated transcription factor binding data. {GEM} has the highest fraction of the top 500 peaks containing the binding motif of the immunoprecipitated factor, with 50\% of its peaks within 10 base pairs of a motif. {BCP} and {MUSIC} perform best on histone data. These findings provide guidance and rationale for selecting the best peak caller for a given application.},

As translational efficiency has a major impact on biological noise, a possible strategy to control noise is to regulate gene expression processes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, fluctuations in the concentration of a green fluorescent protein were compared, at the single cell level, upon transformation of an isogenic bacterial cell population with synthetic gene circuits implementing either a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Experimental measurements showed that protein variability is lower under post-transcriptional control, when the same average protein concentrations are compared. This effect is well reproduced by stochastic simulations, supporting the hypothesis that noise reduction is due to the control mechanism acting on the efficiency of translation. Similar strategies are likely to play a role in noise reduction in natural systems and to be useful for controlling noise in synthetic biology applications.},

Previously, we found that the Nrd1 {CID} is required to recruit the nuclear exosome to the Nrd1 complex, but it was not clear which exosome subunits were contacted. Here, we show that two nuclear exosome cofactors, Mpp6 and Trf4, directly and competitively interact with the Nrd1 {CID} and differentially regulate the association of Nrd1 with two catalytic subunits of the exosome. Importantly, Mpp6 promotes the processing of Nrd1-terminated transcripts preferentially by Dis3, whereas Trf4 leads to Rrp6-dependent processing. This suggests that Mpp6 and Trf4 may play a role in choosing a particular {RNA} processing route for Nrd1-terminated transcripts within the exosome by guiding the transcripts to the appropriate exonuclease.},

Here, we present the largest {ASB} compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 {ASB} events retrieved from 45 {ENCODE} {ChIP-Seq} data sets. Our analysis showed that {ASB} events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the {ChIP'ed} {TF} and potential partner {TFs,} allelic difference of {DNase} I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For {TF} dimers bound symmetrically to {DNA,} {ASB} data revealed that central positions of the {TF} binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on {TF} binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of {ASB} events. Classification models using only {DNase} I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features.

This 2-step mechanism requires that inactive Mcm2-7 complexes be maintained for variable periods of time in a topologically bound state on chromatin, which may create a steric obstacle to other {DNA} transactions. We have recently found in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that Mcm2-7 double hexamers can respond to collisions with transcription complexes by sliding along the {DNA} template. Importantly, Mcm2-7 double hexamers remain functional after displacement along {DNA} and support replication initiation from sites distal to the origin. These results reveal a novel mechanism to specify eukaryotic replication origin sites and to maintain replication origin competence without the need for Mcm2-7 reloading.},

  abstract={The C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNA} polymerase {II} in eukaryotes is comprised of tandemly repeating units of a conserved seven amino acid sequence. The number of repeats is, however, quite variable across different organisms. Furthermore, previous studies have identified evidence of rearrangements within the {CTD} coding region suggesting {DNA} instability may play a role in regulating or maintaining {CTD} repeat number. The work described here establishes a clear connection between {DNA} instability and {CTD} repeat number in S. cerevisiae. First, analysis of 36 diverse S. cerevisiae isolates revealed evidence of numerous past rearrangements within the {DNA} sequence that encodes the {CTD.} Interestingly, the total number of {CTD} repeats was relatively static (24-26 repeats in all strains), suggesting a balancing act between repeat expansion and contraction. In an effort to explore the genetic plasticity within this region we measured the rates of repeat expansion and contraction using novel reporters and a doxycycline-regulated expression system for {RPB1.} In efforts to determine the mechanisms leading to {CTD} repeat variability we identified the presence of {DNA} secondary structures, specifically G-quadruplex-like {DNA,} within the {CTD} coding region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutating {PIF1,} a G-quadruplex specific helicase, results in increased {CTD} repeat length polymorphisms. We also determined that {RAD52} is necessary for {CTD} repeat expansion but not contraction, identifying a role for recombination in repeat expansion. Results from these {DNA} rearrangements may help explain the {CTD} copy number variation seen across eukaryotes, as well as support a model of {CTD} expansion and contraction to maintain {CTD} integrity and overall length.},

  abstract={Dynamic interactions between {RNA} polymerase {II} and various {mRNA-processing} and chromatin-modifying enzymes are mediated by the changing phosphorylation pattern on the C-terminal domain {(CTD)} of polymerase subunit Rpb1 during different stages of transcription. Phosphorylations within the repetitive heptamer sequence {(YSPTSPS)} of {CTD} have primarily been defined using antibodies, but these do not distinguish different repeats or allow comparative quantitation. Using a {CTD} modified for mass spectrometry {(msCTD),} we show that {Ser5-P} and {Ser2-P} occur throughout the length of {CTD} and are far more abundant than other phosphorylation sites. {msCTD} extracted from cells mutated in several {CTD} kinases or phosphatases showed the expected changes in phosphorylation. Furthermore, {msCTD} associated with capping enzyme was enriched for {Ser5-P} while that bound to the transcription termination factor Rtt103 had higher levels of {Ser2-P.} These results suggest a relatively sparse and simple {"CTD} code."},

  abstract={Many genes are expressed in bursts, which can contribute to cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is now possible to measure this heterogeneity with high throughput single cell gene expression assays (single cell {qPCR} and {RNA-seq).} These experimental approaches generate gene expression distributions which can be used to estimate the kinetic parameters of gene expression bursting, namely the rate that genes turn on, the rate that genes turn off, and the rate of transcription. We construct a complete pipeline for the analysis of single cell {qPCR} data that uses the mathematics behind bursty expression to develop more accurate and robust algorithms for analyzing the origin of heterogeneity in experimental samples, specifically an algorithm for clustering cells by their bursting behavior {(Simulated} Annealing for Bursty Expression Clustering, {SABEC)} and a statistical tool for comparing the kinetic parameters of bursty expression across populations of cells {(Estimation} of Parameter changes in Kinetics, {EPiK).} We applied these methods to hematopoiesis, including a new single cell dataset in which transcription factors {(TFs)} involved in the earliest branchpoint of blood differentiation were individually up- and down-regulated. We could identify two unique sub-populations within a seemingly homogenous group of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, we could predict regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression levels of eighteen key hematopoietic transcription factors throughout differentiation. Detailed information about gene regulatory mechanisms can therefore be obtained simply from high throughput single cell gene expression data, which should be widely applicable given the rapid expansion of single cell genomics.},

We found that nucleosomes and specific {DNA-binding} proteins, including the general regulatory factors {(GRFs)} Reb1p, Rap1p, and Abf1p, and Pol {III} transcription factors enhance the efficiency of {NNS} termination by physically blocking Pol {II} progression. The same {DNA-bound} factors that promote {NNS} termination were shown previously to define the 3'-ends of Okazaki fragments synthesized by Pol {\&\#x3B4;} during {DNA} replication. Reduced binding of these factors results in defective {NNS} termination and Pol {II} readthrough. Furthermore, inactivating {NNS} enables Pol {II} elongation through these roadblocks, demonstrating that effective Pol {II} termination depends on a synergy between the {NNS} machinery and obstacles in chromatin. Consistent with this finding, loci exhibiting Pol {II} readthrough at {GRF} binding sites are depleted for upstream {NNS} signals. Overall, these results underscore how {RNA} termination signals influence the behavior of Pol {II} at chromatin obstacles, and establish that common genomic elements define boundaries for both {DNA} and {RNA} synthesis machineries.},

  abstract={The co-transcriptional biogenesis of export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles {(mRNPs)} in yeast is under the surveillance of quality control {(QC)} steps. Aberrant {mRNPs} resulting from inappropriate or inefficient processing and packaging reactions are detected by the {QC} system and retained in the nucleus with ensuing elimination of their {mRNA} component by a mechanism that requires the catalytic activity of Rrp6p, a 3'-5' exonuclease associated with the {RNA} exosome. In previous studies, we implemented a new experimental approach in which the production of aberrant {mRNPs} is massively increased upon perturbation of {mRNP} biogenesis by the {RNA-dependent} helicase/translocase activity of the bacterial Rho factor expressed in S. cerevisiae. The analyses of a subset of transcripts such as {PMA1} led us to substantiate the essential role of Rrp6p in the nuclear {mRNP} {QC} and to reveal a functional coordination of the process by Nrd1p. Here, we extended those results by showing that, in contrast to {PMA1,} Rho-induced aberrant {HXK1} {mRNPs} are targeted for destruction by an Nrd1p- and Rrp6p-independent alternative {QC} pathway that relies on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of Rat1p. We show that the degradation of aberrant {HXK1} {mRNPs} by Rat1p occurs co-transcriptionally following decapping by Dcp2p and leads to premature transcription termination. We discuss the possibility that this alternative {QC} pathway might be linked to the well-known specific features of the {HXK1} gene transcription such as its localization at the nuclear periphery and gene loop formation.},

  abstract={Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary {DNA} strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the {RNA-binding} proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable {(SUTs,} stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable {(CUTs,} cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable {ncRNAs} {(CUTs),} so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable {ncRNAs} {(SUTs),} presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense {RNA} in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome.},

  abstract={Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in molecular biology, biochemistry, and other biosciences utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics; genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies; structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology. The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming, as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses, phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as that of a "variable," the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between two {DNA} sequences.},

  abstract={Epigenetic gene silencing plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and contributes to organismal development and cell fate acquisition in eukaryotes. In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin-associated gene silencing is known to be mediated by {RNA} processing pathways including {RNA} interference {(RNAi)} and a 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex, the exosome. Here, we report a new {RNA-processing} pathway that contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin mediated by 5'-3' exoribonuclease {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2.} Dhp1 mutation causes defective gene silencing both at peri-centromeric regions and at the silent mating type locus. Intriguingly, mutation in either of the two well-characterized Dhp1-interacting proteins, the Din1 pyrophosphohydrolase or the Rhn1 transcription termination factor, does not result in silencing defects at the main heterochromatic regions. We demonstrate that Dhp1 interacts with heterochromatic factors and is essential in the sequential steps of establishing silencing in a manner independent of both {RNAi} and the exosome. Genomic and genetic analyses suggest that Dhp1 is involved in post-transcriptional silencing of repetitive regions through its {RNA} processing activity. The results describe the unexpected role of {Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2} in chromatin-based silencing and elucidate how various {RNA-processing} pathways, acting together or independently, contribute to epigenetic regulation of the eukaryotic genome.},

  abstract={{RAP1} is one of the components of shelterin, the capping complex at chromosome ends or telomeres, although its role in telomere length maintenance and protection has remained elusive. {RAP1} also binds subtelomeric repeats and along chromosome arms, where it regulates gene expression and has been shown to function in metabolism control. Telomerase is the enzyme that elongates telomeres, and its deficiency causes a premature aging in humans and mice. We describe an unanticipated genetic interaction between {RAP1} and telomerase. While {RAP1} deficiency alone does not impact on mouse survival, mice lacking both {RAP1} and telomerase show a progressively decreased survival with increasing mouse generations compared to telomerase single mutants. Telomere shortening is more pronounced in Rap1(-/-) Terc(-/-) doubly deficient mice than in the single-mutant Terc(-/-) counterparts, leading to an earlier onset of telomere-induced {DNA} damage and degenerative pathologies. Telomerase deficiency abolishes obesity and liver steatohepatitis provoked by {RAP1} deficiency. Using genomewide {ChIP} sequencing, we find that progressive telomere shortening owing to telomerase deficiency leads to re-localization of {RAP1} from telomeres and subtelomeric regions to extratelomeric sites in a genomewide manner. These findings suggest that although in the presence of sufficient telomere reserve {RAP1} is not a key factor for telomere maintenance and protection, it plays a crucial role in the context of telomerase deficiency, thus in agreement with its evolutionary conservation as a telomere component from yeast to humans.},

  abstract={Obtaining {RNA-seq} measurements involves a complex data analytical process with a large number of competing algorithms as options. There is much debate about which of these methods provides the best approach. Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to evaluate their performance due in part to a lack of sensitive assessment metrics. We present a series of statistical summaries and plots to evaluate the performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity, available as a {R/Bioconductor} package ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/rnaseqcomp ). Using two independent datasets, we assessed seven competing pipelines. Performance was generally poor, with two methods clearly underperforming and {RSEM} slightly outperforming the rest.},
