maybe paper here? 

\section{Rap1}

\begin{itemize}
\item detection of rb, how many sites, where, biases
\item detection of specific sites with RB
\item effects of Nrd1-AA and rna15, eventually analysis of surrounding features
\end{itemize}

\section{Other factors rb}

\begin{itemize}
\item systematic analysis of mcisaac binding sites
\item taking into account annotated transcription
\item case of ABf1

\end{itemize}

\section{RB in the genome}

\begin{itemize}
\item tRNAs, already described, but show genome wide data and numbers
\item tRNAs reverse. this is new, show combined peaks and provide numbers
\item centromeres. intro + plots at centromeres on both sides
\end{itemize}
