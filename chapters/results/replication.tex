\section{profiling transcription around origins of replication}

\begin{itemize}
\item asymmetric profile
\item peak in front of ORC
\item antisense perplexing peak
\end{itemize}

\section{termination?}

\begin{itemize}
\item global termination profiling, show controls for reb and rap showing that pA is detectable even in WT
\item effect of NNS
\item effect of CPF
\item Roadblock of ORC, julien's plots

\end{itemize}



\section{effects of endogenous transcription}

\begin{itemize}
\item data description from other paper (efficiencies)
\item effects on firing efficiency
\item effects on timing
\end{itemize}

\section{effects when termination is defective}

see other julien's data? 

\section{ORC does not prevent MCM sliding}

figure containing chip sliding? maybe better to determine peaks on both datasets and then kernel smooth the results.
