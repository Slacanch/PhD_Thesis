%general intro on transcription

Transcription of DNA into RNA intermediates constitutes the first step in gene expression.
The quantity and quality of transcripts produced can have significant repercussions on every known biological process.
Even minute changes in transcription patterns can upset the balance of proteins, ribozymes, tRNAs and functional non-coding RNAs, generating a cascade of cellular responses . 
Because of this massive potential, transcription is a complex and finely regulated process: according to \gls{sgd} annotation 1231 out of 6691 genes in \cer (18\%) are described as regulating or taking part in the transcriptional process.

Transcription is divided into three fundamental stages: initiation involves the assembly of an RNA polymerase on a promoter sequence and its interaction with general transcription factors; elongation happens after the polymerase escapes the promoter and is actively transcribing the DNA template; and termination results in the disassembly of the elongation complex and the release of the transcript into the nucleus. 
Each of these stages is 


%transcription is an important process
 %affects the state of the cell
 %even though layers exsist, they act on the basal levels set by transcription
%transcription is finely regulated
%a number of factors contribute to the regulation
%transcription is divided into three foundamental stages
%summarize the stages
%understanding of these three stages is fundamental (?)
