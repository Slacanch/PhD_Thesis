"It is now widely realized that nearly all the 'classical' problems of molecular biology have either been solved or will be solved in the next decade." — Sydney Brenner, 1988


"The results of mathematics are seldom directly applied; it is the definitions that are really useful. Once you learn the concept of a differential equation, you see differential equations all over, no matter what you do. This you cannot see unless you take a course in abstract differential equations. What applies is the cultural background you get from a course in differential equations, not the specific theorems. If you want to learn French, you have to live the life of France, not just memorize thousands of words. If you want to apply mathematics, you have to live the life of differential equations. When you live this life, you can then go back to molecular biology with a new set of eyes that will see things you could not otherwise see." — Gian-Carlo Rota In 'A Mathematician's Gossip', Indiscrete Thoughts (2008), 213.
